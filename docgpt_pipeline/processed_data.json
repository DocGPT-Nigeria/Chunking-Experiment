Abbreviations. 2. Executive summary. 2.1 Guideline translations. 3. Introduction. 4. Prevention. 4.1 Vector control. 4.1.1 Interventions recommended for large-scale deployment.\n\nStrong recommendation for, High certainty evidence: Pyrethroid-only nets (2019). Pyrethroid-only long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) should be deployed for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults living in areas with ongoing malaria transmission. Remark: WHO recommends ITNs that have been prequalified by WHO for deployment in protecting populations at risk of malaria. ITNs are most effective where the principal malaria vector(s) bite predominantly at night after people have retired under their nets. ITNs can be used both indoors and outdoors, wherever they can be suitably hung (though hanging nets in direct sunlight should be avoided, as sunlight can affect insecticidal activity).\n\nConditional recommendation for, Moderate certainty evidence: Pyrethroid-PBO ITNs (2022). Pyrethroid-PBO ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs can be deployed for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission where the principal malaria vector(s) exhibit pyrethroid resistance. Remark: The conditionality of this recommendation is driven by the current higher unit cost of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs and therefore the uncertainty of their affordability in different settings. Furthermore, as PBO is less wash-resistant than pyrethroids, its bioavailability declines faster over the three-year estimated life of an ITN; therefore, the added impact of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs over that of pyrethroid-only LLINs may decline over time. The evidence comes from two sites in eastern Africa with pyrethroid resistance and not from other geographies where transmission levels and vector characteristics may vary. PBO acts by inhibiting certain metabolic enzymes, primarily oxidases, and so are likely to provide greater protection than pyrethroid-only LLINs where mosquitoes display mono-oxygenase-based insecticide resistance mechanisms. In deciding whether pyrethroid-PBO ITNs may be appropriate in their context, malaria programmes should: consider the deployment of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs in areas where resistance to pyrethroids in local vectors has been detected; determine whether resources are adequate to cover the extra cost of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, while ensuring that coverage of populations at risk of malaria is not affected; note that WHO recommends that ITNs prequalified by WHO be selected for deployment.\n\nStrong recommendation for, Moderate certainty evidence: Pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs vs pyrethroid-only LLINs (2023). WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) (5 of 478). Pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs should be deployed instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs for prevention of malaria in adults and children in areas with pyrethroid resistance. Remark: Note: Recommendations on deployment of pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr nets were separated into two distinct recommendations for better clarity, but share the same evidence to decision, justification, practical info and research needs. Please refer to the following section.\n\nConditional recommendation for, Moderate certainty evidence: Pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs vs pyrethroid-PBO ITNs (2023).

Remark: The conditionality of the recommendation to deploy pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs instead of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs is based on the GDG’s judgement that the balance of desirable and undesirable effects probably favours pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs over pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. However, the evidence for this recommendation is from only one trial in Africa. In deciding whether to deploy pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, malaria programmes should: • determine whether resources are adequate to cover the extra costs compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, while ensuring optimal coverage of populations at risk of malaria; • generate additional information or conduct analyses with the aim of maximizing impact through targeted deployment (e.g. stratification of malaria risk, assessment of the characteristics of local vectors, such as pyrethroid resistance mechanisms). ITNs for prevention of malaria in adults and children in areas with pyrethroid resistance; and • note that WHO recommends that ITNs prequalified by WHO be selected for deployment. Conditional recommendation for, Moderate certainty evidence. Pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs vs pyrethroid-only LLINs (2023). Pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs can be deployed instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs for prevention of malaria in adults and children in areas with pyrethroid resistance. Remark: The conditionality of the recommendation to deploy pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs is based on the GDG’s concerns that the available evidence indicates poor cost-effectiveness of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs. Poor cost-effectiveness is a result of both the higher cost compared to a pyrethroid-only net, which would require extra resources to maintain the same coverage, and the relatively short-lived (12 months) additional impact obtained by deploying pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen nets over pyrethroid-only nets. In deciding whether pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs should be deployed instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs, malaria programmes should: • determine whether resources are adequate to cover the extra cost compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs, while ensuring optimal coverage of populations at risk of malaria; • generate additional information or conduct analyses with the aim of maximizing impact through targeted deployment (e.g. stratification of malaria risk, assessment of the characteristics of local vectors, such as pyrethroid resistance mechanisms); and • note that WHO recommends that ITNs prequalified by WHO be selected for deployment. Note: Recommendations on deployment of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen nets were separated into two distinct recommendations for better clarity, but share the same evidence to decision, justification, practical info and research needs. Please refer to the following section. Conditional recommendation against, Moderate certainty evidence. Pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs vs pyrethroid-PBO ITNs (2023). Pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs are not recommended for deployment over pyrethroid-PBO ITNs for prevention of malaria in adults and children in areas with pyrethroid resistance. Remark: The conditionality of the recommendation against the deployment of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs instead of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs is based on the GDG’s judgement that the balance of effects favours pyrethroid-PBO ITNs over pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs and that, based on current cost and efficacy data, pyrethroid-PBO ITNs are more cost-effective. The GDG acknowledged that evidence to support this recommendation is derived from only a single trial in Africa. Strong recommendation for, High certainty evidence. Insecticide-treated nets: Humanitarian emergency setting (2022). Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) should be deployed for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission affected by a humanitarian emergency. Remark: This recommendation is limited to classes of ITNs currently recommended by WHO. As with ITNs deployed in more stable settings, WHO recommends that ITNs that are prequalified by WHO be selected for use in humanitarian emergencies. When considering deployment of ITNs in humanitarian emergencies, the infrastructure, access, logistical capacity and resources available must be taken into account, as these may influence the feasibility and cost of procuring and deploying nets. Practice Statement. Achieving and maintaining optimal coverage with ITNs for malaria prevention and control (2019). To achieve and maintain optimal ITN coverage, countries should apply mass free net distribution through campaigns, combined with other locally appropriate delivery mechanisms such as continuous distribution using antenatal care (ANC) clinics and the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). Recipients of ITNs should be advised (through appropriate communication strategies) to continue using their nets, irrespective of the condition and age of the net, until a replacement net is available. Practice Statement. Management of old ITNs (2019). Old ITNs should only be collected where there is assurance that: i) communities are not left without nets, i.e. new ITNs are distributed to replace old ones; and ii) there is a suitable and sustainable plan in place for safe disposal of the collected material. If ITNs and their packaging (bags and baling materials) are collected, the best option for disposal is high-temperature incineration. They should not be burned in the open air. In the absence of appropriate facilities, they should be buried away from water sources and preferably in non-permeable soil. Recipients of ITNs should be advised (through appropriate communication strategies) not to dispose of their nets in any water body, as the residual insecticide on the net can be toxic to aquatic organisms (especially fish). Strong recommendation for, Very low certainty evidence Updated. Indoor residual spraying (2025). IRS should be deployed for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults living in areas with ongoing malaria transmission. Remark: WHO recommends that products from the insecticide classes indicated below be used for IRS. Selection of the product should be made from the WHO list of prequalified products, and with due consideration of the insecticide susceptibility of the local malaria vector(s). 4.1.2 Co-deploying ITNs and IRS. IRS is considered to be an appropriate intervention where: • the majority of the vector population feeds and rests indoors; • people mainly sleep indoors at night; • the malaria transmission pattern is such that the population can be protected by one or two rounds of IRS per year; and • the majority of structures are suitable for spraying. Conditional recommendation for, Very low certainty evidence. Indoor residual spraying: Humanitarian emergency setting (2022). IRS can be deployed for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission affected by a humanitarian emergency. Remark: The conditionality of this recommendation is largely driven by the very low certainty of the evidence that IRS reduces malaria in",

    "content": "Indoor residual spraying: Humanitarian emergency setting (2022)\nIRS can be deployed for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission affected by a humanitarian emergency.\nRemark:\nThe conditionality of this recommendation is largely driven by the very low certainty of the evidence that IRS reduces malaria in such settings and due to concerns around feasibility and cost.\nWhen deciding whether IRS may be appropriate for prevention and control of malaria in humanitarian emergency settings, programmes should consider:\n• whether the structures are suitable for spraying. Some shelters provided in emergency settings may not be suitable for application of insecticides, such as open-sided structures and those built from materials that affect the residual nature of the insecticides;\n• whether the target coverage of IRS can be feasibly achieved in the setting;\n• whether there are sufficient resources to cover the relatively high costs associated with an IRS programme. In such settings, transport of commodities to hard-to-reach areas, coupled with the need to quickly procure items and establish human capacity to deliver the intervention, is likely to incur higher costs than when deploying IRS in more stable settings.\nAs with the deployment of IRS in more stable settings, WHO recommends that products from insecticide classes indicated under the WHO recommendation, and that have been WHO-prequalified be selected for IRS use in humanitarian emergencies.\nIt is important to ensure that the vector population is susceptible to the insecticide selected for spraying.\nConditional recommendation for, Moderate certainty evidence\nPrioritize optimal coverage with either ITNs or IRS over combination (2019)\nThe co-deployment of ITNs and IRS is not recommended for prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission. Priority should be given to delivering either ITNs or IRS at optimal coverage and to a high standard, rather than introducing the second intervention as a means to compensate for deficiencies in the implementation of the first intervention.\nRemark:\nIn settings where optimal ITN coverage, as specified in the strategic plan, has been achieved and where ITNs remain effective, additionally implementing IRS may have limited utility in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality. Given the resource constraints across malaria endemic countries, it is recommended that effort be focused on good-quality implementation of either ITNs or IRS, rather than deploying both in the same area. However, the combination of these interventions may be considered for resistance prevention, mitigation or management should sufficient resources be available.\nPractice Statement\nAccess to ITNs or IRS at optimal coverage levels (2019)\nAccess to effective vector control using ITNs or IRS at optimal coverage levels should be ensured for all populations at risk of malaria in most epidemiological and ecological settings.\nPractice Statement\nWHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO)\n8 of 478\n4.1.3 Supplementary interventions\nNo scale-back in areas with ongoing local malaria transmission (2019)\nIn areas with ongoing local malaria transmission (irrespective of both the pre-intervention and current level of transmission), vector control interventions should not be scaled back. Ensuring access to effective malaria vector control at optimal levels for all inhabitants of such areas should be pursued and maintained.\nConditional recommendation for, Low certainty evidence\nLarviciding (2019)\nInsecticides can be regularly applied to water bodies (larviciding) for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults as a supplementary intervention to ITNs or IRS in areas with ongoing malaria transmission where aquatic habitats are few, fixed and findable.\nRemark:\nThe conditionality of this recommendation is due to the low certainty of evidence, the impact being limited to non-extensive habitats, and concerns about feasibility. When considering larviciding, programmes should note the following:\n• Larviciding only reduces vector density and so does not have the same potential for health impact as ITNs and IRS; ITNs provide protection from biting vectors and both ITNs and IRS reduce adult longevity.\n• Larviciding should not be seen as a substitute for ITNs or IRS or a means to fill a coverage gap in areas with significant malaria risk; rather, larviciding represents a potential supplementary strategy for malaria control.\n• Feasibility and cost-effectiveness should be taken into account; larviciding will generally be most cost-effective in areas where larval habitats are few, fixed and findable, and likely less feasible in areas where the aquatic habitats are abundant, scattered and variable.\nThe following settings are potentially the most suitable for larviciding as a supplementary measure implemented alongside ITNs or IRS:\n• urban areas, where breeding sites are relatively few, fixed and findable in relation to houses (which are targeted for ITNs or IRS); and\n• arid regions, where larval habitats may be few and fixed throughout much of the year.\nLarval habitat modification and/or larval habitat manipulation (2021)\nNo recommendation can be made because the evidence on the effectiveness of a specific larval habitat modification and/or larval habitat manipulation intervention for the prevention and control of malaria was deemed to be insufficient.\nLarvivorous fish (2019)\nNo recommendation can be made because no evidence on the effectiveness of larvivorous fish for the prevention and control of malaria was identified.\nConditional recommendation against, Low certainty evidence\nTopical repellents (2023)\nThe deployment of topical repellents in areas with ongoing malaria transmission is not recommended if the aim is to prevent and control malaria at the community level.\nRemark:\nThe panel recommended against the implementation of topical repellents if the main aim is to control malaria at the community level, given the lack of evidence of significant impact. To achieve community-level impact, it is likely that a high level of individual compliance would be needed. The panel noted that topical repellents may, however, offer protection for individuals and for high-risk groups who do not benefit from other vector control interventions; however, studies demonstrating impact against malaria at the individual level or in specific risk groups are required to support a formal recommendation.\nConditional recommendation against, Low certainty evidence\nInsecticide-treated clothing (2019)\nDeployment of insecticide-treated clothing is not recommended for the prevention and control of malaria at the community level in areas with ongoing malaria transmission; however, insecticide-treated clothing may be beneficial as an intervention to provide personal protection against malaria in specific population groups.\nRemark:\nThe GDG recommended against the deployment of insecticide-treated clothing due to the lack of evidence of an impact in the general population. In the absence of ITNs, there is some evidence that insecticide-treated clothing may reduce the risk of malaria infection in specific populations such as refugees and military personnel.",

    "content": "Remark:\nThe GDG recommended against the deployment of insecticide-treated clothing due to the lack of evidence of an impact in the general population. In the absence of ITNs, there is some evidence that insecticide-treated clothing may reduce the risk of malaria infection in specific populations such as refugees and military personnel.\nConditional recommendation for, Moderate certainty evidence New\nSpatial emanators (2025)\nSpatial emanators can be deployed for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission.\nRemark:\nThe conditionality of the recommendation to deploy spatial repellents is based on the GDG’s judgement that the balance of desirable and undesirable effects probably favours deployment alongside ITNs or IRS, but considers that the systematic review found considerable heterogeneity in protective effect, largely explained by different levels of coverage achieved with the spatial repellent in each trial. The GDG therefore noted that effective protection of the population with spatial repellents depends on continuous high coverage in the target area, with duration of efficacy of the product and distribution model being the key determinants of feasibility and cost-effectiveness.\nIn deciding whether to deploy spatial emanators as a supplementary intervention, malaria programmes should:\n• ensure that targeted coverage levels of interventions recommended for large-scale deployment (ITNs, IRS) are achieved and sustained;\n• determine whether resources are adequate to cover the extra costs, especially given the residual efficacy of the specific spatial repellent product under consideration;\n• generate additional information or conduct analyses with the aim of maximizing impact through targeted deployment (e.g. stratification of malaria risk, assessment of the characteristics of local vectors, such as local vector susceptibility to the active ingredient);\n• note that only indoor use of spatial emanators has been assessed in the development of this recommendation, and therefore the recommendation only covers the indoor use of spatial emanators at this time; and\n• note that WHO recommends selecting spatial emanators that are prequalified by WHO for deployment.\nConditional recommendation against, Very low certainty evidence\nSpace spraying (2019)\nSpace spraying is not recommended for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission; IRS or ITNs should be prioritized instead.\nRemark:\nThe panel recommended against the deployment of space spraying to control malaria, given the lack of evidence of impact against malaria.

Furthermore, programmes would need to consider a number of local contextual factors when considering screening of residential houses as a public health strategy, such as:\n• how the intervention will be delivered and maintained;\n• whether the structure and condition of the residential houses in the community allow for the installation of screening;\n• the feasibility and resources needed for implementation, especially if deployed on a large scale.\nProgrammes should note that this recommendation addresses the use of screening of windows, ceilings, doors and/or eave spaces, and does not cover other ways of blocking entry points into houses.\nStrong recommendation for, Moderate certainty evidence\nIntermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (2022)\nIn malaria-endemic areas, pregnant women of all gravidities should be given antimalarial medicine at predetermined intervals to reduce disease burden in pregnancy and adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes.\nRemark:\n• Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) has been widely used for malaria chemoprevention during pregnancy and remains effective in improving key pregnancy outcomes.\n• IPTp-SP should start as early as possible in the second trimester and not before week 13 of pregnancy.\n• Doses should be given at least one month apart, with the objective of ensuring that at least three doses are received.\n• Antenatal care (ANC) contacts remain an important platform for delivering IPTp. Where inequities in ANC service and reach exist, other delivery methods (such as the use of community health workers) may be explored, ensuring that ANC attendance is maintained and underlying inequities in ANC delivery are addressed.\n• IPTp is generally highly cost-effective, widely accepted, feasible for delivery and justified by a large body of evidence generated over several decades.\nConditional recommendation for, Moderate certainty evidence\nPerennial malaria chemoprevention (2022)\nIn areas of moderate to high perennial malaria transmission, children belonging to age groups at high risk of severe malaria can be given antimalarial medicines at predefined intervals to reduce disease burden.\nRemark:\n• Perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC) schedules should be informed by the age pattern of severe malaria admissions, the duration of protection of the selected drug, and the feasibility and affordability of delivering each additional PMC course (see “Practical info”).\n• Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) has been widely used for chemoprevention in Africa, including for PMC.

Thresholds for assessing these criteria change over time and location. Malaria programmes should assess the suitability of SMC based on the local malaria epidemiology and available funding (see “Practical info”). The added value of a seasonally targeted intervention is likely to be greatest where transmission is intensely seasonal.\n• Monthly cycles of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine (SP+AQ) have been widely used for SMC in African children under 5 years old and have been shown to be efficacious, safe, well tolerated, available and inexpensive (Thwing et al unpublished evidence).\nConditional recommendation for, Low certainty evidence\nIntermittent preventive treatment of malaria in school-aged children (2022)\nSchool-aged children living in malaria-endemic settings with moderate to high perennial or seasonal transmission can be given a full therapeutic course of antimalarial medicine at predetermined times as chemoprevention to reduce disease burden.\nRemark:\n• Intermittent preventive treatment in school-aged children (IPTsc) has been evaluated in children aged 5–15 years. The burden of malaria and benefits of IPTsc may vary across this age range, but evidence is limited.\n• National malaria programmes can consider IPTsc if resources allow for its introduction among school-aged children without compromising chemoprevention interventions for those carrying the highest burden of severe disease, such as children < 5 years old.\n• Schools may provide a low-cost means to deliver chemoprevention to school-aged children. However seasonal variation in malaria transmission and the timing of school terms, as well as equity concerns, may mean alternative delivery channels are needed to maximize impact.\n• First- and second-line malaria treatments should not be used for IPTsc if safe and effective alternatives are available (see “Practical info”).\n• The dosing schedule for IPTsc should be informed by the local malaria epidemiology and timed to give protection during the period of greatest malaria risk (see “Practical info”).\n• Moderate to high malaria transmission settings are defined as areas with P. falciparum parasite prevalence greater than 10% or an annual parasite incidence greater than 250 per 1000 [30].

Therefore, if MDA is implemented, it should be one of several components of a robust malaria control programme (including good coverage of effective case management and appropriate prevention tools and strategies).\n• Malaria programmes should judge the suitability of using MDA in their context based on the desired impact, level of endemicity, and resources required.

However, the biological effects of MDA on disease in non-emergency settings are likely to translate to MDA recipients in emergency settings. The size of effect will vary according to the type of emergency and level of disruption to health services, as well as underlying transmission intensity, choice of drug, delivery method and other factors.\n\nConditional recommendation for, Low certainty evidence: MDA to reduce transmission of P. falciparum in very low to low transmission settings (2022). In areas with very low to low levels of P. falciparum transmission, antimalarial medicine can be given as chemoprevention through MDA to reduce transmission.\n\nRemark: MDA may quickly reduce transmission of P. falciparum in very low to low transmission areas, but the effect wanes within 1–3 months. Therefore, if MDA is implemented, it should be one of several components of a robust malaria elimination programme (including, at minimum, good coverage of case-based surveillance with parasitological diagnosis, effective antimalarial treatment, and appropriate prevention tools and strategies) in order to reduce the risk of resurgence after the MDA programme has ended. MDA should be considered only for geographical areas where there is limited risk of importation of malaria. Very low to low transmission settings are defined as areas with P. falciparum parasite prevalence less than 10%, or P. falciparum incidence less than 250 cases per 1000 population per year. These thresholds should not be regarded as absolutes.\n\nConditional recommendation against, Very low certainty evidence: MDA to reduce transmission of P. falciparum in moderate to high transmission settings (2022). In areas with moderate to high levels of P. falciparum transmission, providing antimalarial medicine through MDA to reduce transmission is not recommended.\n\nRemark: The studies included in the systematic review did not demonstrate evidence that MDA has either a short- or long-term effect on P. falciparum transmission in moderate to high settings. Moderate to high transmission settings are defined as areas with P. falciparum parasite prevalence greater than 10%, or P. falciparum incidence above 250 cases per 1000 population per year.\n\nConditional recommendation for, Very low certainty evidence: MDA to reduce transmission of P. vivax (2022). In areas with P. vivax transmission, antimalarial medicine can be given as chemoprevention through mass drug administration (MDA) to reduce transmission.\n\nRemark: MDA may quickly reduce transmission of P. vivax, but the effect wanes within 1–3 months. If MDA is implemented, it should be part of a robust malaria elimination programme (including effective antimalarial treatment including treatment for hypnozoites). Programmes considering implementing MDA for P. vivax should carefully reflect on how to safely and feasibly administer treatment to prevent relapses.\n\nConditional recommendation against, Very low certainty evidence: Mass relapse prevention (MRP) to reduce transmission of P. vivax (2022). Mass treatment with an 8-aminoquinoline medicine alone to reduce the transmission of P. vivax is not recommended.\n\nRemark: Without testing for G6PD deficiency, there is potential for severe harm from the use of a therapeutic dose of an 8-aminoquinoline for radical cure of P. vivax hypnozoites. Conducting G6PD testing for a large population would significantly add to the complexity and cost of the intervention. A better strategy would likely be an MDA programme providing a schizonticide in addition to an 8-aminoquinoline.\n\nStrong recommendation for, High certainty evidence: Malaria vaccines (2023). WHO recommends the use of malaria vaccines for the prevention of P. falciparum malaria in children living in malaria-endemic areas, prioritizing areas of moderate and high transmission. Vaccines should be provided in a four-dose schedule in children from 5 months of age for the reduction of malaria disease and burden. The minimum interval between any doses is four weeks; the fourth dose should be given 6–18 months after the third dose.",

    "content": "To improve coverage, there can be flexibility in the timing of the fourth dose, including by aligning it with vaccines given in the second year of life. Alternatively, because the vaccine efficacy is highest in the first months after vaccination, the fourth dose can be given just prior to seasonal peaks in malaria transmission to optimize vaccine efficacy. A fifth dose, given one year after the fourth dose, may be provided in areas of highly seasonal transmission and may be considered in other areas where a significant malaria risk remains for children, depending on a local assessment of feasibility and cost-effectiveness. In areas with highly seasonal malaria transmission or perennial malaria transmission with seasonal peaks, countries may consider providing the vaccine using an age-based or seasonal approach. Alternatively, countries could consider a hybrid of these approaches, giving the first three doses through age-based administration and subsequent annual doses seasonally [iii]. At the time of vaccine introduction, catch-up vaccination can be considered in children up to 5 years of age, subject to local epidemiology and age of high risk, feasibility, affordability and vaccine availability. Malaria vaccines should be provided as part of a comprehensive malaria control strategy. All malaria control interventions, including vaccines, provide partial protection; the highest impact is achieved when a mix of interventions is used. Appropriate mixes of interventions (ITNs, preventive chemotherapies, vaccines, etc.) should be identified for different subnational settings. These mixes are defined by national malaria programmes on the basis of the local malaria epidemiology (e.g. intensity of transmission, age pattern of severe disease, vector species and behaviour, and insecticide and drug resistance patterns) and contextual factors (e.g. structure and function of the health care system). [i] Moderate and high transmission settings are defined as areas with a P. falciparum parasite prevalence greater than 10% PfPR2-10 or an annual parasite incidence greater than 250 cases per 1000 population. These thresholds are indicative and should not be regarded as absolutes for determining the applicability of the malaria vaccine recommendation. [ii] Although the WHO prequalification issued for the RTS,S/AS01 and R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccines permits children to receive the first dose from 5 months of age, the RTS,S/AS01 manufacturer’s licensure specifies from 6 weeks to 17 months of age. Studies with RTS,S/AS01 indicated lower efficacy if the first dose was given around 6 weeks of age. However, the efficacy of RTS,S/AS01 and R21/Matrix-M vaccines is unlikely to be reduced substantially if the first dose is given at 4, rather than 5, months of age. [iii] An age-based vaccination approach provides the first three vaccine doses when children become age-eligible (with a minimum of four weeks between doses) and a fourth dose 6–18 months after the third dose. A seasonal vaccination approach provides the first three vaccine doses just prior to the malaria transmission season (with a minimum of four weeks between doses) and subsequent doses just prior to the transmission season. A hybrid vaccination approach involves giving the first three doses through an age-based approach and subsequent doses just prior to the transmission season. Practice Statement: Diagnosing malaria (2015). All cases of suspected malaria should have a parasitological test (microscopy or RDT) to confirm the diagnosis. Both microscopy and RDTs should be supported by a quality assurance programme. Strong recommendation for, High certainty evidence. Artemisinin-based combination therapy (2015). Children and adults with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria should be treated with one of the following ACTs*: artemether-lumefantrine (AL), artesunate-amodiaquine (AS+AQ), artesunate-mefloquine (ASMQ), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAP), artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+SP), artesunate-pyronaridine (ASPY) (2022). *Artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and artesunate-pyronaridine are not recommended for use in the first trimester of pregnancy. Artesunate-pyronaridine (ASPY) is recommended as an artemisinin-based combination therapy option for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Remark: ASPY should be avoided by individuals with known liver disease (clinically apparent liver disease) because ASPY is associated with liver transaminitis. Pharmacovigilance should be strengthened where ASPY is used for the treatment of malaria. Duration of ACT treatment (2015): ACT regimens should provide 3 days’ treatment with an artemisinin derivative. Revised dose recommendation for dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine in young children (2015): Children weighing <25kg treated with dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine should receive a minimum of 2.5 mg/kg bw per day of dihydroartemisinin and 20 mg/kg bw per day of piperaquine daily for 3 days. Reducing the transmissibility of treated P. falciparum infections (2024): In low-transmission areas, a single dose of 0.25 mg/kg bw primaquine should be given with an ACT to patients with P. falciparum malaria (except pregnant women) to reduce transmission. G6PD testing is not required. Treatment in the first trimester of pregnancy (2022): Pregnant women with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria should be treated with artemether-lumefantrine during the first trimester. Antifolates are contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy.",

In areas with chloroquine-resistant infections, adults and children with uncomplicated P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae or P. knowlesi malaria should be treated with an ACT.\nPractice Statement Blood stage infection (2024): The G6PD status of patients should be used to guide administration of either primaquine or tafenoquine for preventing relapse.\nStrong recommendation for, Moderate certainty evidence Qualitative near-patient G6PD tests (2024): Qualitative near-patient tests for G6PD deficiency should be used to inform administration of specific treatment regimens to prevent relapses of P. vivax and P. ovale. G6PD non-deficient individuals can receive 0.5 mg/kg/day primaquine for 14 days or 0.5 mg/kg/day primaquine for 7 days.\nRemark: In males and females, <30% of normal G6PD activity is considered deficient. In patients undergoing G6PD activity testing, near-patient qualitative tests for G6PD deficiency are considered highly accurate to distinguish G6PD above or below a threshold of 30% of normal G6PD activity. These tests cannot be used to identify females with intermediate G6PD deficiency (30–70% G6PD activity) due to a heterozygous genotype. Instead, females with G6PD activity in this intermediate range will be classified as normal with a qualitative test.\nStrong recommendation for, Moderate certainty evidence Semi-quantitative near-patient G6PD tests (2024): 5.2.1.7 Anti-relapse treatment of P. vivax and P. ovale. Semi-quantitative near-patient tests with fixed standard thresholds for deficient, intermediate and normal G6PD activity should be used to inform administration of specific treatment regimens. The dose of 1 mg/kg/day primaquine for 7 days or single dose tafenoquine should only be given to those above the threshold that corresponds to >70% of normal G6PD activity; and 0.5 mg/kg/day primaquine for 14 days or 0.5 mg/kg/day primaquine for 7 days can be given to those with a threshold that corresponds to > 30% of normal G6PD activity to prevent relapses of P. vivax and P. ovale.\nRemark: In males and females, <30% of normal G6PD activity is considered deficient; females with G6PD activity between 30% and 70% due to a heterozygous genotype are considered to have intermediate G6PD activity and are also (but less so) at risk of haemolysis. In patients undergoing G6PD activity testing, near-patient semi-quantitative tests for G6PD deficiency with fixed thresholds corresponding to >30% and <70% of normal G6PD activity are considered highly accurate at a threshold of 30% of normal G6PD activity to indicate whether P. vivax and P. ovale patients are G6PD deficient, and are considered accurate at a threshold of ≤ 70% activity to indicate whether P. vivax and P. ovale patients are deficient or have intermediate G6PD activity.\nConditional recommendation for, Low certainty evidence Tafenoquine as anti-relapse therapy (2024): Tafenoquine is recommended as an alternative to primaquine (3.5 mg/kg total dose) for preventing relapses of P. vivax in patients ≥ 2 years of age, who have ≥ 70% G6PD activity and who receive chloroquine treatment.\nRemark: These recommendations pertain only to South America. Quantitative or semi-quantitative determination of G6PD activity must be done before tafenoquine administration. Tafenoquine is not recommended in pregnant and lactating women. Tafenoquine is not recommended in patients receiving artemisinin-based combination therapies for the treatment of P. vivax. Controlled deployment and/or further research is encouraged outside of South America, to generate evidence of the efficacy and safety of tafenoquine compared to primaquine as an anti-relapse treatment. No data is available comparing tafenoquine with primaquine given at a total dose of 7.0 mg/kg.\nStrong recommendation for, Moderate certainty evidence Primaquine as anti-relapse therapy (2024): To prevent relapse, children and adults (except pregnant women, infants aged < 1 month and women breastfeeding infants aged < 1 month, and people with G6PD deficiency), primaquine should be given at a high total dose (7 mg/kg) at 0.5 mg/kg/day for 14 days or 1 mg/kg/day for 7 days for prevention of relapses in patients with uncomplicated P. vivax or P. ovale malaria.\nRemark: The primaquine high dose (7 mg/kg) should be provided at 1 mg/kg/day for 7 days only to patients with ≥70% G6PD activity. National decisions regarding the two high-dose (7 mg/kg) primaquine regimens given over 7 or 14 days will be affected by the availability of G6PD semi-quantitative testing and capacity for supervised therapy.

Once a patient has received at least 24 h of parenteral therapy and can tolerate oral therapy, treatment should be completed with 3 days of an ACT.\nStrong recommendation for\nTreating severe malaria in children (2015)\nChildren weighing < 20 kg should receive a higher dose of artesunate (3 mg/kg bw per dose) than larger children and adults (2.4 mg/kg bw per dose) to ensure equivalent exposure to the drug.\n*Not evaluated using the GRADE framework; recommendation based on pharmacokinetic modelling\nConditional recommendation for, Low certainty evidence\nParenteral alternatives when artesunate is not available (2015)\nIf artesunate is not available, artemether should be used in preference to quinine for treating children and adults with severe malaria.\nStrong recommendation for, Moderate certainty evidence\nPre-referral treatment options (2015)\n5.2.3 Other considerations in treating malaria\n5.2.3.1 Management of malaria cases in special situations\n5.2.3.2 Quality of antimalarial drugs\n5.2.3.3 Monitoring efficacy and safety of antimalarial drugs and resistance\n5.3 National adaptation and implementation\nWhere complete treatment of severe malaria is not possible, but injections are available, adults and children should be given a single intramuscular dose of artesunate, and referred to an appropriate facility for further care. Where intramuscular artesunate is not available, intramuscular artemether or, if that is not available, intramuscular quinine should be used.\nWhere intramuscular injection of artesunate is not available, children < 6 years should be treated with a single rectal dose (10mg/kg bw) of artesunate, and referred immediately to an appropriate facility for further care. Rectal artesunate should not be used in older children and adults.\nPractice Statement\nAntimalarial drug quality (2015)\nNational drug and regulatory authorities should ensure that the antimalarial medicines provided in both the public and the private sectors are of acceptable quality, through regulation, inspection and law enforcement.\nPractice Statement\nMonitoring efficacy and safety of antimalarial drugs and resistance (2010)\nAll malaria programmes should regularly monitor the therapeutic efficacy of antimalarial drugs using the standard WHO protocols.\nAn antimalarial medicine that is recommended in the national malaria treatment policy should be changed if the total treatment failure proportion is ≥ 10%, as assessed in vivo by monitoring therapeutic efficacy.\nThe introduction of a new antimalarial medicine in the national treatment policy should be based on the treatment having an average cure rate of > 95% as assessed in clinical trials.\nPractice Statement\nNational adaptation and implementation (2010)\nThe choice of ACTs in a country or region should be based on optimal efficacy, safety and adherence.\nAn antimalarial medicine that is recommended in the national malaria treatment policy should be changed if the total treatment failure proportion is ≥ 10%, as assessed in vivo by monitoring therapeutic efficacy.\nIntroduction of a new antimalarial medicine in the national treatment policy should be based on the treatment having an average cure rate of > 95% as assessed in clinical trials.\nPractice Statement\nNational adaptation and implementation (2022)\nDrugs used as first line treatment should not be used in IPTp, PMC, SMC, IPTsc or MDA.\nPractice Statement\nNational adaptation and implementation (2015)\nWhen possible: fixed-dose combinations should be used rather than co-blistered or loose, single-agent formulations; and for young children and infants, paediatric formulations, with a preference for solid formulations (e.g. dispersible tablets) should be used rather than liquid formulations.\n6.

    "content": "Remark: The GDG noted that there may be exceptional circumstances under which MTaT might be appropriate, such as a transmission focus in a very low transmission or post-elimination setting where MDA is not an acceptable or feasible strategy.\nConditional recommendation for, Very low certainty evidence: Targeted drug administration to reduce transmission of malaria (2022). In areas with very low to low transmission or post-elimination settings preventing re-establishment of transmission, antimalarial medicine can be given as chemoprevention to people with increased risk of infection relative to the general population to reduce transmission.\nRemark: Persons given antimalarials should be those with increased risk of infection compared to the general population and their infections should constitute a large proportion of the parasite reservoir in the area. The factors identifying individuals or groups at increased risk of infection should be easy to recognise, thereby improving the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. Programmes considering implementing targeted drug administration for P. vivax should carefully consider how to safely and feasibly administer treatment to prevent relapses. Care should be taken to avoid stigmatizing groups at increased risk of infection. Additional complementary strategies to eliminate or prevent re-establishment of malaria transmission should be in place.\nConditional recommendation against, Very low certainty evidence: Targeted testing and treatment to reduce transmission of malaria (2022). Testing and treatment of people with an increased risk of infection relative to the general population to reduce the transmission of malaria is not recommended.\nRemark: The GDG noted that there may be limited circumstances under which targeted testing and treatment (TTaT) could be beneficial. For example, TTaT could be used when people at a higher risk of infection can be easily identified and chemoprevention is not acceptable to the population. Additionally, TTaT could be used if safe and effective implementation of radical cure to prevent P. vivax relapses is only feasible for those with confirmed infections.\n6.3 Interventions in response to detection of confirmed malaria cases: 6.3.1 Reactive drug administration (RDA); 6.3.2 Reactive case detection and treatment (RACDT).\nRoutine malaria testing and treatment at points of entry (2022): Routine malaria testing and treatment of people arriving at points of entry (land, sea or air) to reduce importation is not recommended.\nRemark: No studies of the impact of testing and treatment at points of entry on the rate of malaria importation were found by the systematic review. Routine testing and treatment for malaria at points of entry is unlikely to be acceptable or feasible to implement.\nConditional recommendation for, Very low certainty evidence: Malaria testing and treatment of organized or identifiable groups arriving or returning from malaria-endemic areas (2022). In areas approaching elimination or post-elimination settings preventing re-establishment of transmission, organized or identifiable groups arriving or returning from malaria-endemic areas can be tested and treated soon after entry to reduce importation of malaria. Relatively easy access to these groups within a short time after entry is required for this strategy to be feasible and acceptable. This strategy may be particularly critical to areas in post-elimination that are working to prevent re-establishment of transmission.\nConditional recommendation for, Low certainty evidence: Reactive drug administration for reducing malaria transmission (2022). In areas approaching elimination or post-elimination settings preventing re-establishment of transmission, antimalarial medicine can be given as chemoprevention to all people residing with or near a confirmed malaria case and all people who share the same risk of infection (e.g. co-travellers and co-workers) to prevent or reduce malaria transmission.\nRemark: Programmes implementing reactive drug administration (RDA) should have the capacity to conduct case investigations at the residence to determine the likely location of infection and to identify those individuals co-exposed with the index case. Programmes implementing RDA should have the capacity to enumerate and provide antimalarials to the people residing with or near a confirmed malaria case and others that share the same risk of infection. The people given antimalarial medicine in an RDA intervention should share the same risk of having acquired infection as the index case or be at risk of acquiring infection from the index case. This includes residents in the same household or neighborhood, co-travellers and co-workers. However, if the infection was imported and the residence is not located in a receptive area, there may be no benefit from RDA. Programmes contemplating implementation of RDA for P. vivax should carefully consider how to safely and feasibly administer treatment to prevent relapses.\nConditional recommendation for, Very low certainty evidence: Reactive case detection and treatment to reduce transmission of malaria (2022). In areas approaching elimination or post-elimination settings preventing re-establishment of transmission, all people residing with or near a confirmed malaria case and all people who share the same risk of infection (e.g. co-travellers and co-workers) can be tested for malaria and treated if positive.\nRemark: Until an area is nearing elimination or is post-elimination, it is unlikely that reactive case detection and treatment (RACDT) will have any effect on malaria transmission. However, RACDT becomes an essential component of surveillance when countries are nearing interruption of transmission to monitor progress towards elimination. When countries are post-elimination and working towards certification, RACDT can strengthen a country’s claim that it has reached and maintained zero indigenous cases. RACDT is an essential part of surveillance and response to prevent re-establishment of malaria.\n6.3.3 Reactive indoor residual spraying.\nConditional recommendation for, Moderate certainty evidence: Reactive indoor residual spraying (2022). In areas approaching elimination or post-elimination settings preventing re-establishment of transmission, indoor residual spraying of insecticide can be conducted in the houses of confirmed cases and neighbours to prevent or reduce transmission of malaria.\nRemark: In areas approaching elimination or post-elimination settings where proactive indoor residual spraying (IRS) is occurring, programmes can consider switching to reactive IRS only, depending on the receptivity of the area. Programmes considering adding reactive IRS on top of proactive IRS should balance the potential added benefit with ongoing programme costs.\nWHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO).",

Executive summary: The consolidated WHO Guidelines for malaria present all of the current WHO recommendations for malaria. These are the product of careful evaluation following standardized methods as part of the WHO process for developing guidelines [1]. The recommendations for malaria vaccines have been developed following the procedures of the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE). WHO uses strictly defined processes to assess the quality, consistency and completeness of evidence to determine the strength of each recommendation. WHO malaria recommendations are intended to be short, evidence-based, actionable statements. They are usually accompanied by supplementary remarks drawing attention to contextual and implementation considerations that may influence the appropriateness and impact of a recommendation in different settings. Clearly distinguishing recommendations from their associated contextual considerations provides information national policy-makers to consider when adopting and adapting the recommended strategies that are most appropriate in their settings. This online platform and the associated PDF help to distinguish the formal recommendations from the supplementary statements. The Global Malaria Programme will use this platform to produce 'living guidelines', which can be updated more rapidly than printed documents as new evidence becomes available. The tabs below each recommendation enable users to access the research evidence and evidence-to-decision (EtD) frameworks that informed the recommendation. There is also a feedback tab where users are encouraged to provide input directly related to each intervention. Scope: The consolidated WHO Guidelines for malaria bring together all recommendations for malaria, including prevention using vector control, preventive chemotherapy and the vaccine; diagnosis, treatment and elimination strategies. The Guidelines also provide links to other resources including unpublished evidence reviewed at the time of formulating recommendations, guidance and information on strategic",

The Guidelines also provide links to other resources including unpublished evidence reviewed at the time of formulating recommendations, guidance and information on strategic use of information to drive impact, surveillance, monitoring and evaluation, operational manuals, handbooks and frameworks, and a glossary of terms and definitions. The Guidelines provide: • evidence-based recommendations pertaining to vector control tools, technologies and approaches that are currently available for malaria prevention and control, and for which sufficient evidence on their efficacy is available to support systematic reviews. The Guidelines are intended to provide an underlying framework for the design of effective, evidence-based national vector control strategies and their adaptation to local disease epidemiology and vector bionomics; • evidence-based recommendations on the use of antimalarial medicines as preventive chemotherapy in people living in malaria-endemic areas who are at risk of malaria morbidity and mortality. These approaches include intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) in pregnancy (IPTp), perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC), seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), intermittent preventive treatment in school aged children (IPTsc), post-discharge malaria chemoprevention (PDMC) and mass drug administration (MDA); • evidence-based recommendation on the use of the malaria vaccine; • evidence-based recommendations on the treatment of uncomplicated and severe malaria in all age groups and situations, including in young children and pregnant women; and • guidance on interventions in the final phase of elimination and prevention of re-establishment. No guidance is given on the use of antimalarial agents to prevent malaria in people travelling from non-endemic settings to areas of malaria transmission. This is available in the WHO International travel and health guidance [2]. WHO guidelines, recommendations and good practice statements A WHO guideline is any document developed by WHO containing recommendations for clinical practice, or public health practice or health policy. A recommendation informs the intended end-user what he or she can or should do in specific situations to achieve the best possible health outcomes, individually and/or collectively. It guides the choice among different interventions or measures to ensure a positive impact on health and implications for the use of resources. In certain situations, good practice statements may be provided. These statements reflect the consensus of the Guidelines Development Group (GDG) that the benefits of adhering to the intervention or course of action are large and unequivocal, and do not need to be supported by a systematic evidence review or could be based on indirect evidence. The primary purpose of these WHO Guidelines is to support policy-makers in ministries of health and the managers of national malaria control programmes in endemic countries to establish national policies and plans tailored to their local context. Link to WHO prequalification When a recommendation is linked to the introduction of a new tool or product, there is a parallel process managed by the WHO Prequalification Team to ensure that diagnostics, medicines, vaccines and vector control products meet global standards of quality, safety and efficacy, in order to optimize use of health resources and improve health outcomes. The prequalification process consists of a transparent, scientifically sound assessment, including dossier review, consistency testing or performance evaluation, and site visits to manufacturers. This information, in conjunction with other procurement criteria, is used by the United Nations (UN) and other procurement agencies to make purchasing decisions regarding these health products. This parallel process aims to ensure that recommendations are linked to prequalified products and that prequalified products are linked to a recommendation for use. Expert input is important for the interpretation of the evidence, and the development of guidance may rely on expert opinion, particularly in areas where the evidence is currently weak, scarce or absent. For example, the vector control recommendations presented in the Guidelines are based on a consideration of the evidence gained from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and other types of trials and studies, as well as the technical knowledge and experience of the GDG and External Review Group involved in the standard guideline development process. Updating evidence-based guidance The first edition of these consolidated Guidelines was released in early 2021 as a compilation of the existing recommendations for malaria vector control and treatment. This version of the Guidelines includes revised information regarding the WHO recommendation for use of indoor residual spraying (IRS) to prevent malaria. The update was informed by a GDG review of data related to efficacy and contextual factors for two new insecticides for use in IRS (chlorfenapyr and isocycloseram). While the overarching recommendation remains largely unchanged, the evidence profiles have been updated with the addition of these two new insecticides, and there is an emphasis on continuing to reduce the use of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) for IRS for malaria control. There is also a new recommendation for spatial emanators (also known as spatial repellents), in light of new evidence on the use of this intervention. Future updates for treatment include recommendations that are already in the Guidelines but for which the evidence was not previously subjected to the GRADE process, and new molecules under development that will be included once the evidence base becomes available. Readers should note the dates of individual recommendations. Revisions to these Guidelines will be communicated via the Global Malaria Programme website and through WHO’s standard dissemination channels. From this point forward, these consolidated Guidelines represent the latest and definitive reference for all WHO guidance on malaria. An update log detailing all updates from one release to the next is available on the Global Malaria Programme website. Dissemination These consolidated WHO Guidelines for malaria are available on the MAGICapp online platform, linked to the WHO malaria website. The original English version has been translated into French, Spanish and Arabic. All research evidence and references are available on the web platform and will be available to download, and relevant implementation guidance will be linked to the recommendations. When recommendations are updated, they will be labelled as such and will always display the date of the most recent update. Each time there is an update, an updated PDF version of the Guidelines will be downloadable on the WHO Global Malaria Programme website to facilitate access where the Internet is not reliably available.

Introduction: Background: Malaria continues to cause unacceptably high levels of disease and death, as documented in successive editions of the World malaria report [3]. According to the latest report, there were an estimated 263 million cases and 597 000 malaria deaths globally in 2023. Malaria is preventable and treatable, and the global priority is to reduce the burden of disease and death while retaining the long-term vision of malaria eradication. Here, we present the WHO Guidelines for malaria developed by the WHO Global Malaria Programme as a comprehensive and inclusive resource for advice on malaria. The Global technical strategy for malaria 2016–2030 [4] (GTS) provides an overarching framework to guide malaria control and elimination efforts. Adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2015 and update adopted in May 2021, the Strategy defines goals, milestones and targets on the path to a world free of malaria (Table 1). The goals focus attention on the need to both reduce morbidity and mortality, and to progressively eliminate malaria from countries that had malaria transmission in 2015. The GTS presents a framework through which the goals can be achieved (Figure 1). Table 1. Goals, milestones and targets for the Global technical strategy for malaria 2016–2030: Goals (1. Reduce malaria mortality rates globally compared with 2015 - Milestones/Targets: 2020: At least 40%, 2025: At least 75%, 2030: At least 90%), (2. Reduce malaria case incidence globally compared with 2015 - Milestones/Targets: 2020: At least 40%, 2025: At least 75%, 2030: At least 90%), (3. Eliminate malaria from countries in which malaria was transmitted in 2015 - Milestones/Targets: 2020: At least 10 countries, 2025: At least 20 countries, 2030: At least 35 countries), (4. Prevent re-establishment of malaria in all countries that are malaria-free - Milestones/Targets: Re-establishment prevented for all years). The GTS [4] states that it is essential for malaria programmes to “ensure access to malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment as part of universal health coverage” (Fig.1, Pillar 1). Universal health coverage (UHC) means that all individuals and communities receive the health services they need without suffering financial hardship. It includes the full spectrum of essential, quality health services, from the promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care. For malaria, WHO has recommended a range of interventions –namely, vector control, chemoprevention, diagnostic testing and treatment - to reduce transmission and prevent morbidity and mortality. A UHC approach means ensuring that individuals and communities are covered by the appropriate mix of these interventions, based on local context, to control and ultimately eliminate malaria. Table 2. Global technical strategy for malaria 2016–2030: framework, pillars and supporting elements: Pillar 1. Ensure access to malaria prevention; Pillar 2. Accelerate efforts towards elimination and attainment of malaria-free status; Pillar 3. Transform malaria surveillance into a key interventions; Supporting element 1. Harnessing innovation and expanding research; Supporting element 2. Strengthening the enabling environment for sustainable and equitable results. The second pillar of the GTS urges all countries to accelerate efforts towards elimination and attainment of a malaria-free status. Progress towards elimination is a continuous process and not a set of independent stages. Countries, subnational areas and communities are situated at different points along the malaria transmission continuum. Malaria transmission intensity varies within a country or area, as does the level of investment, biological determinants, environmental factors, strength of health systems and social, demographic, political and economic factors. Strategies will need to be tailored to the local setting by taking into account the local context and epidemiology of malaria. The principal objective of national malaria programmes (NMPs) is to combine a selection of these interventions into packages that are tailored to achieve sustainable and equitable impact in a given setting. To decide upon the appropriate intervention package and allocation of resources that will achieve this objective and contribute to UHC, programmes should use a process that combines the analysis of impact and value for money with extensive stakeholder engagement and discussion. The process should be informed by past and current malaria transmission intensity and incidence data; contextual vulnerability related to the human host, parasites, vectors, and past and present intervention coverage; acceptability; and equality of access and use (including analysis of financial barriers and how to address them). When the objective is elimination, a similar process is undertaken, although the types of interventions and value for money analysis will be different than in high-burden settings. Following progressive reductions in malaria burden between 2000 and 2015, progress stalled. By 2017, the world was off track to achieve the malaria morbidity and mortality reduction targets. In response, a revitalization effort called “High burden to high impact (HBHI)” was launched in 2018 [5]. This approach focuses attention on how to get back on track: garnering political will to reduce the toll of malaria; using strategic information to drive impact; developing better guidance, policies and strategies; and improving coordination of support for national malaria responses. Although the impetus for articulating these key activities was the need to get back on track to achieve the GTS morbidity and mortality targets, these activities apply equally well to all malaria-endemic countries and to ensure continued progress towards the GTS elimination goals. Objectives: These consolidated WHO Guidelines for malaria aim to provide the latest evidence-based recommendations in one reference to support countries in their efforts to reduce and ultimately eliminate malaria. The objectives of the Guidelines are: • to provide evidence-based and context-sensitive recommendations on the appropriate choice(s) for malaria prevention (vector",

The objectives of the Guidelines are:\n• to provide evidence-based and context-sensitive recommendations on the appropriate choice(s) for malaria prevention (vector control, preventive chemotherapies and the vaccine), case management (diagnosis and treatment) across all transmission settings and interventions in the final phase of elimination and prevention of re-establishment;\n• to support WHO Member States in the development of national malaria policies for prevention and case management across all transmission settings;\n• to encourage the use of local data to inform subnational stratification to maximize the impact of available resources; and\n• to inform the research agenda to enable updates to the Guidelines by identifying gaps in evidence that constrain the development of guidance or weaken current recommendations.\nEvidence base\nThese Guidelines are based on the synthesis of the available evidence on the health effects of interventions, and the grading of the certainty of that evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. The synthesized and graded evidence on the health effects of interventions, as well as any evidence on contextual factors, is used to develop an evidence-to-decision (EtD) framework for each recommendation [6]. The judgement of the expert panel on the different factors in the EtD framework (including the certainty of evidence) is transparently captured and facilitates the determination of the strength and direction of each recommendation.\nExpert input is important for the interpretation of the evidence, and the development of guidance may rely on expert opinion, particularly in areas where the evidence is currently weak, scarce or absent. For example, the vector control recommendations presented in the Guidelines are based on a consideration of the evidence gained from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and other types of trials and studies, as well as the technical knowledge and experience of the GDG and External Review Group involved in the standard guideline development process. Details of how evidence is considered are presented in Section 8: Methods. Details of contributors for specific recommendations are presented in Section 10: Contributors and interests.\nTarget audience\nThe primary audience for these Guidelines is policy-makers in ministries of health and the managers of NMPs in endemic countries. The Guidelines may also be of interest to health care practitioners, environmental health service professionals, procurement agencies, the private sector, and civil society groups. The Guidelines are also intended for use by international development partners, donors and funding agencies in order to support decision-making on allocation of resources for interventions and procurement of appropriate malaria control products. In addition, the Guidelines are intended to guide researchers, research funders and those interested in the outcomes of research to address the evidence gaps that are constraining the development of guidance or weakening current recommendations.\nEquity, gender and human rights\nThe right to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health (commonly referred to as the right to health) is enshrined in several international human rights treaties, regional agreements, and national constitutions and laws. Member States have minimum “core” obligations that include “the prevention, treatment and control of epidemic, endemic, occupational and other diseases” [7].\nYet, gender-based discrimination, human rights violations, and inequities related to social, economic, environmental, commercial and political determinants of health deprive billions of people around the world of their right to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health and well-being. It is of great concern that, over the past few years, health inequities have been exacerbated by the impacts of the ongoing and interlinked crises of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), conflict, climate change, food insecurity and the global economy.\nToo many people are missing out on the interventions they need to keep them healthy, including interventions to prevent and treat malaria. According to a WHO report [8], malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS are diseases that predominantly impact the chronically disadvantaged. While the magnitude and extent of health inequalities remain poorly understood, it is clear that certain population groups have persistently higher disease mortality and morbidity and more limited access to life-saving interventions. The report documents that the poorest, least educated and rural groups are less likely to seek care for children with fever.\nIn most countries, Member States have not adequately identified and addressed social and structural barriers to health, or taken action to ensure gender equality, equity and human rights. Communities are often excluded from health decision-making, even though people are entitled to active, free and meaningful participation in decisions that directly affect them, such as the design, implementation and monitoring of health interventions. Participation increases ownership and helps to ensure that policies and programmes are responsive to the needs of the people they are intended to benefit.\nThe existing inequities are barriers to achieving global and national goals and targets on malaria. Successful implementation of malaria control interventions should, therefore, be viewed through a human rights and health equity lens. This means fully acknowledging the importance of engaging people in the design and delivery of health and care systems to meet their needs, and empowering them to make informed decisions about their health and take action.\nAs many of the malaria interventions are reliant on broader health care delivery platforms, a rights-based approach is required to ensure that quality health services and programmes are available, accessible and acceptable to all those in need, including nomadic populations, individuals with disabilities, out-of-school youth, and those living in sparsely populated and underserved areas far from health services and schools.\nNational programmes should address inequity concerns by monitoring the coverage of recommended interventions among individuals in identified risk categories and targeting those most at risk. Health inequities and barriers to health need to be systematically identified and addressed by Member States and other stakeholders through gender-responsive, equitable and human rights-based health systems, with a focus on individuals and groups experiencing intersecting forms of discrimination, marginalization and/or social exclusion.\nEtiology\nMalaria is a life-threatening disease caused by the infection of red blood cells with protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Four species of Plasmodium (P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and P. ovale) most commonly infect humans. P. falciparum and P. vivax are the most prevalent species and P. falciparum is the",

    "content": "Malaria is transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Four species of Plasmodium (P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and P. ovale) most commonly infect humans. P. falciparum and P. vivax are the most prevalent species and P. falciparum is the most dangerous. A fifth species, P. knowlesi (a species of Plasmodium that primarily infects non-human primates) is increasingly being reported in humans inhabiting forested regions of some countries of South-East Asia and the Western Pacific regions, and in particular on the island of Borneo. Malaria transmission, acquisition of immunity, and clinical manifestations of disease. The intensity of transmission depends on factors related to the parasite, the vector, the human host and the environment. Transmission tends to be more intense in places where the mosquito lifespan is longer and where the females prefer to bite humans rather than other animals. The survival and longevity of female mosquitoes is of critical importance in malaria transmission, as the malaria parasite generally requires a period of 7–10 days to develop inside the mosquito into a form that is infective to humans. Female mosquito longevity is dependent on intrinsic, genetic factors, as well as on environmental factors including temperature and humidity. The strong human-biting habit of the African vector species is one of the reasons why approximately 90% of the world’s malaria cases occur in Africa. Transmission intensity is usually assessed as the incidence of cases or the prevalence of infection. Most countries have information on the annual parasite incidence (number of new parasitologically confirmed malaria cases per 1000 population per year) from routine surveillance and/or on the parasite prevalence from surveys, often conducted during or just after periods of peak transmission [9]. The following categories of transmission intensity are indicative and meant to provide an adaptable framework in which each country can conduct a stratification exercise to classify geographical units according to local malaria transmission. • Areas of high transmission are characterized by an annual parasite incidence of 450 or more cases per 1000 population and a P. falciparum prevalence rate of ≥35%. • Moderate transmission areas have an annual parasite incidence of 250–450 cases per 1000 population and a prevalence of P. falciparum/P. vivax malaria of 10–35%. • Areas of low transmission have an annual parasite incidence of 100–250 cases per 1000 population and a prevalence of P. falciparum/P. vivax of 1–10%. It should be noted that the incidence of cases or infections is a more useful measure in geographical units in which the prevalence is low, given the difficulty of measuring prevalence accurately at low levels [10]. • Very low transmission areas have an annual parasite incidence of < 100 cases per 1000 population and a prevalence of P. falciparum/P. vivax malaria that is > 0 but < 1%. The relation between parasite incidence, parasite prevalence and the number of cases presenting to health facilities per week can be estimated using models [11]. Differences in transmission from one area to another may be due to geographical characteristics, such as altitude, temperature, humidity, rainfall patterns, proximity to water bodies, land use, vector species and distribution, socio-demographic characteristics, access to antimalarial treatment, and coverage with vector control. In most endemic areas, seasonal patterns of transmission are observed, with high transmission during part of the year. Both the intensity and timing of transmission are important considerations in designing elimination strategies. The manifestation of clinical disease depends strongly on the background level of acquired protective immunity, which is a consequence of the pattern and intensity of malaria transmission in the area of residence. In areas of moderate to high transmission, partial immunity to clinical disease and a reduced risk of developing severe malaria are acquired in early childhood. The pattern of acquired immunity is similar across the Sahel subregion, where malaria transmission is intense only during the three- or four-month rainy season and low at other times. In both these situations, clinical disease is confined mainly to young children, who may develop high parasite densities that can progress rapidly to severe malaria. By contrast, in these settings, adolescents and adults are partially immune and suffer clinical disease much less frequently, although they are often infected with low blood-parasite densities. Immunity is modified in pregnancy and gradually lost, at least partially, when individuals move out of the endemic areas for prolonged periods (e.g. a year or more). In areas of low and very low transmission, as found in much of Asia, Latin America and other malaria-endemic areas, the transmission fluctuates widely by season, year, and over relatively small distances. P. vivax is an important cause of malaria in these regions. This generally low transmission delays acquisition of immunity, so that adults and children alike suffer from acute clinical malaria, with a significant risk for progression to severe malaria if left untreated. Epidemics may occur in these low or very low transmission areas when the inoculation rate increases rapidly because of a sudden increase in vectorial capacity. Epidemics may result in a very high incidence across all age groups, which can overwhelm health services. In moderate and high transmission areas with sustained high coverage of vector control and access to treatment, reduced exposure to malaria infection may change the population structure of acquired immunity to reflect that found in low or very low transmission areas, resulting in a corresponding change in the clinical epidemiology of malaria and an increasing risk of epidemics if control measures are not sustained. Recommendations and supporting implementation guidance. Evidence-informed recommendations are a critical component to support the development of national malaria strategic plans; they are intended to communicate “what to do”. A second critical element is the strategic use of local data. This informs an understanding of the contextual diversity within each malaria-endemic country. Local data provide an understanding of the different types of settings – or strata – within each country. This is an essential prerequisite to identify the optimal mix of interventions and the best means to deliver them in the different subnational strata. The Global Malaria Programme is working with countries to strengthen the generation and use of local information for stratification, the definition of optimal mixes of interventions, and the rational, safe and ethical prioritization of resources to maximize impact. The Guiding principles for prioritizing malaria interventions in resource-constrained country contexts to achieve maximum impact [12] provide a framework for country decision-making to define the most appropriate mix of malaria interventions for specific geographical areas or risk groups when resources are constrained. Local data are also essential to understand the impact of the strategies deployed, providing opportunities to further refine sub-national strategies and inform global knowledge.",

    "content": "framework for country decision-making to define the most appropriate mix of malaria interventions for specific geographical areas or risk groups when resources are constrained. Local data are also essential to understand the impact of the strategies deployed, providing opportunities to further refine sub-national strategies and inform global knowledge. WHO also develops implementation guidance such as operational and field manuals to support the “how” aspect of delivering the recommended tools and strategies. Operational manuals and other guidance hold practical information for increasing the target population's access to interventions. These documents are referenced and linked to these Guidelines. The Global Malaria Programme is working to align this implementation guidance with the recommendations in the WHO Guidelines for malaria. However, where there are inconsistencies, the Guidelines should be the default resource for national decisions. Countries may use the implementation guidance to define ways in which a recommendation can be implemented effectively – for example, intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in pregnancy could be implemented through antenatal care and/or community distribution. The intention of the guidance is to enable delivery, not to prescribe exactly how it should be done. Strategic information to tailor programmatic response and selection of interventions. As malaria control improves, malaria transmission and risk become increasingly heterogeneous, both between and within countries. Thus, a “one-size-fits all” approach to programme decisions on intervention selection becomes inefficient. The situation requires stratification of the country at subnational levels according to past, present and future malaria risk, the structure and function of the health system, and other contextual factors. Stratification provides a rational basis to identify context-specific packages of interventions to target specific populations in the different subnational strata. Local data are essential to complete stratification and to inform the selection of the optimal mixes of interventions to maximize impact. Given that resource constraints usually limit the implementation of all desirable interventions in all areas of malaria risk, a prioritization exercise must also be conducted to ensure that resource allocation also optimizes intervention mixes and resultant impact. Guidance on these activities is available in Section 7: Surveillance. The choice of interventions in each stratum should be informed by WHO’s recommendations. However, given the complexities of malaria, with heterogeneity of risk and the unique contexts that every programme has to consider, global guidance is not intended and should not be used to provide prescriptive guidance on what should be done in every situation. These Guidelines signal a paradigm shift towards a problem-solving approach using local data to identify recommendations that are relevant at a country level and based on local context, defining stratum-specific packages of interventions that optimize impact and are prioritized for resource allocation. This shift moves away from overly prescriptive recommendations and will clearly distinguish evidence-informed recommendations from contextual considerations. The contextual considerations at national and subnational levels will inform how recommendations should be applied and strategies that may increase access for the target population. Accurate stratification of malaria transmission intensity is essential for effective targeting of interventions. As countries progress towards elimination, finer scale mapping is required, and stratification should be more specific, ideally at the level of localities or health facility catchment areas [13][14]. As transmission intensity is progressively reduced, stratification needs to include vulnerability and receptivity to malaria, i.e. the risk for importation of malaria cases and the inherent potential of the vector-human ecosystem to transmit malaria. The Guidelines provide a framework within which NMPs and their implementing partners may adopt and adapt the recommendations for use. Good quality surveillance data can also feed into this process by providing the granular local information needed to inform and evaluate national programme decisions (see Section 7: Surveillance). Where the boundaries of current knowledge are pushed, it is particularly important to ensure adequate attention to monitoring and evaluation. The information generated can then feed into updated guidance. 4. Prevention. Nearly half of the world’s population is at risk of malaria. In areas with high malaria transmission, young children and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to malaria infection and death. Since 2000, expanded access to WHO-recommended malaria prevention tools and strategies – including effective vector control and the use of preventive chemotherapies – has had a major impact in reducing the global burden of this disease. 4.1 Vector control. Background. The consolidated Guidelines incorporate: i) recommendations based on systematic reviews of the available evidence on the effectiveness of vector control interventions conducted since the launch of the Guidelines; and ii) existing WHO recommendations developed previously. The Guidelines commence by providing general recommendations on malaria vector control, followed by more specific recommendations on individual interventions and good practice statements on their deployment. The interventions are divided into categories of those recommended for large-scale deployment and those recommended as supplementary. Interventions that are recommended for large-scale deployment are those that have demonstrated public health value, i.e. have proven protective efficacy to reduce or prevent infection and/or disease in humans at the individual level, community level or both, and that are broadly applicable for populations at risk of malaria in most epidemiological and ecological settings. Malaria vector control interventions recommended for large-scale deployment are: i) ITNs that are prequalified by WHO, which in many settings continue to be pyrethroid-only long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs); and ii) indoor residual spraying (IRS) with a product prequalified by WHO. Specific product choices within these broad intervention types should be informed by insecticide resistance data for the target area(s) and other information compiled during sub-national prioritization exercises. Once optimal coverage with one of these interventions has been achieved, supplementary interventions may be considered for deployment depending on the specifics of the population, situation or setting. These include personal protection measures that have a primary use-pattern of protecting individual users, although they may have some as yet unproven impact when deployed at the community level. Vectors, their behaviour and distribution. Malaria is transmitted through the bites of infective female Anopheles mosquitoes. Of the more than 400 different species of Anopheles mosquitoes, only around 40 are malaria vectors of major importance. Anopheles mosquitoes lay their eggs in water. The eggs hatch to produce larvae, which undergo several moults before emerging from the pupal stage as adult mosquitoes.",

    "content": "Malaria is transmitted through the bites of infective female Anopheles mosquitoes. Of the more than 400 different species of Anopheles mosquitoes, only around 40 are malaria vectors of major importance. Anopheles mosquitoes lay their eggs in water. The eggs hatch to produce larvae, which undergo several moults before emerging from the pupal stage as adult mosquitoes. Different species of Anopheles mosquitoes have their own preferred aquatic habitats; for example, some prefer small, shallow collections of fresh water such as puddles and animal hoof prints, whereas others prefer large, open water bodies including lakes, swamps and rice fields. Both male and female mosquitoes feed on plant nectar, but it is just the female mosquitoes that feed on blood as they require protein to develop their eggs. Different mosquito species demonstrate preferences for feeding on animals (zoophily) or on humans (anthropophily); however, these preferences are not absolute, and females may take a blood meal from non-preferred hosts when these are present in the area. Different hosts may be more or less attractive to mosquitoes than others. Several factors have been implicated in the attraction of female mosquitoes to a host, including exhaled carbon dioxide, lactic acid, host odours, warmth and moisture. Blood-feeding can take place inside human habitations (endophagy) or outdoors (exophagy), depending on the mosquito species, and this has implications for the selection and effectiveness of vector control interventions. Female Anopheles mosquitoes blood feed predominantly at night, although some species may bite during the day in heavily shaded conditions, and some exhibit a peak in biting activity in the early evening or early morning. The blood-feeding preferences (zoophily/anthropophily, endophagy/exophagy) as well as the interplay between the peak biting time of Anopheles vectors and the activity and sleeping patterns of the human hosts has important consequences for malaria transmission and the choice of appropriate vector control interventions. After blood-feeding, female mosquitoes rest in order to digest the blood meal and mature their eggs. Female mosquitoes may rest indoors (endophily) or outdoors (exophily), and this depends on innate species preferences as well as the availability of suitable resting sites in the local environment. The mosquitoes’ choice of post-feeding resting site should also be considered when selecting appropriate control interventions. It is important to note that while an individual species of Anopheles will characteristically exhibit certain biting and resting behaviours, these are not absolute; subpopulations and individuals may exhibit different behaviours depending on a combination of intrinsic genetic factors, availability of preferred hosts and availability of suitable resting sites. Environmental and climatic factors, including rainfall, moonlight, wind speed, etc., as well as the deployment of vector control interventions can all influence biting and resting behaviours. Accurate species identification is crucial for all studies and surveillance activities on field populations of vectors. Many of the vectors belong to species complexes and require advanced molecular analyses for species identification, necessitating appropriate laboratory resources. Without accurate species identification, the data collected on behaviour, distribution and infection rates will have limited use for decision-making by control programmes. Background and rationale for vector control: The role of arthropods in the transmission of diseases to humans was first elucidated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since effective vaccines or drugs were not always available for the prevention or treatment of these diseases, control of transmission often had to rely principally on control of the vector. Early control activities included the screening of houses, the use of mosquito nets, the drainage or filling of swamps and other water bodies used by insects for breeding, and the application of oil or Paris green to breeding places. Following the discovery of the insecticidal properties of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in the 1940s and subsequent discovery of other insecticides, the focus of malaria vector control shifted to the deployment of insecticides to target both the larval and adult stages of mosquito vectors. Nowadays, it is well established that effective vector control programmes can make a major contribution to advancing human and economic development. Aside from direct health benefits, reductions in vector-borne diseases enable greater productivity and growth, reduce household poverty, increase equity and women’s empowerment, and strengthen health systems [15]. Despite the clear evidence in broad support of vector control efforts, the major vector-borne diseases combined still account for around 17% of the estimated global burden of communicable diseases, claiming more than 700,000 lives every year [16]. Recognizing the great potential to enhance efforts in this area, WHO led the development of the Global vector control response 2017–2030 [16], which is outlined in the subsequent section. Between 2000 and 2015, the infection prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum in endemic Africa was halved and the incidence of clinical disease fell by 40% [17]. Malaria control interventions averted an estimated 663 million (credible interval (CI) 542–753 million) clinical cases in Africa, with ITNs making the largest contribution (68% of cases averted). Indoor residual spraying (IRS) contributed an estimated 13% (11–16%), with a larger proportional contribution where intervention coverage was high [17]. Global vector control response 2017–2030: The vision of WHO and the broader infectious diseases community is a world free of human suffering from vector-borne diseases. In 2017, the World Health Assembly welcomed the Global vector control response 2017–2030 [16] (GVCR) and adopted a resolution to promote an integrated approach to the control of vector-borne diseases. The approach builds on the concept of integrated vector management (IVM), but with renewed focus on improved human capacity, strengthened infrastructure and systems, improved surveillance, and better coordination and integrated action across sectors and diseases. Development programmes, including, for example, irrigated agriculture, hydroelectric dam construction, road building, forest clearance, housing development and industrial expansion, all have the potential to influence vector-borne diseases, offering the opportunity for intersectoral collaboration and the adoption of strategies other than those based on insecticides. The ultimate aim of the GVCR is to reduce the burden and threat of vector-borne diseases through effective, locally adapted, sustainable vector control in full alignment with Sustainable Development Goal 3.3: to end epidemics of malaria by 2030. Effective and sustainable vector control is achievable only with sufficient human resources, an enabling infrastructure and a functional health system. As recommended under the GVCR, national programmes should lead a vector control needs assessment across the relevant sectors [18] to help appraise current capacity, define the requisite capacity to conduct proposed activities, identify",

As recommended under the GVCR, national programmes should lead a vector control needs assessment across the relevant sectors [18] to help appraise current capacity, define the requisite capacity to conduct proposed activities, identify opportunities for improved efficiency in vector control delivery, and guide resource mobilization to implement the national strategic plan. Prevention, mitigation and management of insecticide resistance. Widespread and increasing insecticide resistance poses a threat to effective malaria vector control. Failure to mitigate and manage insecticide resistance is likely to result in an increased burden of disease, potentially reversing some of the substantial gains made in controlling malaria over the last decade. WHO maintains a global insecticide resistance database and an online mapping tool that consolidate information on the status of the insecticide susceptibility of Anopheles mosquitoes in malaria-endemic countries. The latest data reveal that almost 90% of the malaria-endemic countries reporting insecticide resistance have detected resistance of their vectors to at least one insecticide class. Globally, resistance to pyrethroids is widespread, having been detected in at least one malaria vector in 68% of the sites for which data were available. Resistance to organochlorines was reported in 64% of the public sites. Resistance to carbamates and organophosphates was less prevalent, detected in 34% and 28% of the sites that reported monitoring data, respectively [3]. To date, there is no evidence of operational failure of vector control programmes as a direct result of increasing frequency of pyrethroid resistance [19][20]. Based on past experience, however, it is likely that operational failure will eventually occur if effective insecticide resistance management (IRM) strategies are not designed and implemented. Ideally, such strategies should be implemented early to prevent the spread and increase in the intensity of resistance. The overarching concepts of such resistance management strategies were outlined in the Global plan for insecticide resistance management in malaria vectors (GPIRM) in 2012 [21]. Guidance on monitoring of insecticide resistance, interpretation of test results and implications for decision-making are given in the WHO Manual for monitoring insecticide resistance in mosquito vectors and selecting appropriate interventions [22] and in the Framework for a national plan for monitoring and the management of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors [23]. When deciding whether adjustments to the national malaria strategic plan are required in a given area, at least the following must be considered for that locality: • current and past transmission levels; • current and past interventions deployed, including the coverage, usage and duration of efficacy; • the insecticide resistance profile of the main vector species (including resistance intensity and resistance mechanisms); and • other entomological information including vector species distribution, abundance and other bionomic data. The susceptibility of mosquitoes to insecticides and determination of the species-specific presence, intensity and mechanisms of resistance in vector populations can be used to guide the selection of the most appropriate insecticidal products to deploy. Generally, if mosquitoes are found to be resistant to an insecticide, insecticides with a different mode of action should be deployed. However, there are reports of mosquitoes having differential susceptibility to insecticides within the same class, and questions have been raised about the level of cross-resistance between pyrethroid products [21]. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria recently commissioned a review of the interpretation of insecticide resistance assays when selecting insecticidal products [24]. The review aimed to answer the question: In areas where pyrethroid resistance exists, but mosquitoes of the same population differ in their susceptibility to different pyrethroids, should programmes consider selecting one pyrethroid over another in order to manage insecticide resistance? Based on a review of evidence from molecular, laboratory and field data, the authors concluded that differences between adult mosquito mortalities in pyrethroid insecticide resistance assays are not indicative of a true or operationally relevant difference in the potential performance of pyrethroids currently in common use (deltamethrin, permethrin, α-cypermethrin and λ-cyhalothrin). Consequently, switching between pyrethroid insecticides (to improve intervention efficacy) should not be used as a means of managing insecticide resistance. This finding supports WHO’s past and present position. Given that pyrethroid resistance in mosquitoes is widespread, WHO encourages the development and continued evaluation of nets treated with alternative insecticides [25]. Key technical principles for addressing insecticide resistance are as follows: • Insecticides should be deployed with care and deliberation in order to reduce unnecessary selection pressure and maximize their impact on disease. National malaria programmes (NMPs) should consider whether they are using insecticides judiciously, carefully and with discrimination, and if there is a clear epidemiological benefit. • Vector control programmes should avoid using a single class of insecticide everywhere and over consecutive years. Whenever possible, vector control programmes should diversify insecticide use, to preserve the effectiveness of each individual insecticide class. Although pyrethroids may continue to be used for ITNs in the near term, they should not generally be deployed for IRS in areas with pyrethroid ITNs, whether alone, or in combination with insecticides from a different class. • IRM principles and methods should be incorporated into all vector control programmes, not as an option, but as a core component of an IVM programme. • Strengthening coordination and collaboration among key sectors, such as the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of the Interior and local administration, is crucial for the effective implementation of NMPs. This collaboration can help to ensure a comprehensive strategy for managing insecticide use and addressing resistance issues by adopting the One Health approach. NMPs should engage with the agricultural sector to coordinate insecticide use, with the aim of avoiding use of the same classes of insecticide for both crop protection and public health within the same geographical area. • Routine monitoring of insecticide resistance is essential to inform the selection and deployment of insecticides, and to develop effective IRM approaches. • The additional costs of using new vector control tools as part of a comprehensive IRM response and IVM approach should be weighed against the potential long-term public health impact. Where feasible, a formal economic evaluation is encouraged.",

Where feasible, a formal economic evaluation is encouraged/recommended to investigate the likely incremental costs and effectiveness of potential approaches, relative to feasible alternatives, for a given context. Approaches Historically, the most common way insecticides have been deployed to control malaria vectors has been through “sequential use”. In essence, this is when a single insecticide class is used continuously or repeatedly until resistance has rendered it less effective or ineffective, after which a switch is made to an insecticide with a different mode of action to which there is no (or less) resistance. In theory, this may allow for an eventual switch back to the original insecticide class if resistance decreases to the point that it is no longer detectable by means of bioassays. The agricultural industry has had some success in managing resistance by using different insecticides over space and time. Similar approaches have been proposed with the aim of preventing or delaying the spread and increase of resistance by removing selection pressure or by killing resistant mosquitoes. These strategies include mixtures of insecticides, mosaic spraying, rotations of insecticides and deployment of multiple interventions in combination. Mixtures are co-formulations that combine two or more insecticides with different modes of action. Effective deployment of a mixture requires the presence of resistance to all insecticides in the mixture to be rare, so that any individual mosquito that survives exposure to one insecticide is highly likely to be killed by the other insecticide or insecticides. Ideally, all insecticides in a mixture should have a similar residual life and remain bioavailable over time; in practice, this is difficult to achieve, particularly for vector control products that are meant to last for a number of years, such as long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). An ITN product containing a pyrethroid and the pyrrole insecticide chlorfenapyr, as well as a product containing a pyrethroid and the juvenile hormone mimic pyriproxyfen have been developed, prequalified by WHO and recommendations for their use were published within these guidelines in March 2023. For IRS, a mixture of a pyrethroid and a neonicotinoid insecticide has been prequalified by WHO. Rotations involve switching between insecticides with different modes of action at pre-set time intervals, irrespective of resistance frequencies. The theory is that resistance frequencies will decline (or at least not increase) during the period of non-deployment of insecticides with a specific mode of action. Mosaics involve the deployment of insecticides with different modes of action in neighbouring geographical areas. The optimal spatial scale (size of areas) for mosaics has yet to be determined, and rotations are generally considered to be more practical and feasible. Combinations expose the vector population to two classes of insecticides with differing modes of action through the co-deployment of different interventions in the same place, such as ITNs co-deployed with non-pyrethroid IRS (where both are at high coverage; see recommendation under section 4.1.2). For malaria vector control, however, there is still little evidence of the success of these strategies and no consensus on the best IRM approach or approaches to apply in a given situation. Success of a particular approach will likely depend on mosquito genetics, behaviour and population dynamics, and the chemical nature of the insecticides and their formulation. A 2013 review of experimental and modelling studies on insecticide, pesticide and drug resistance concluded that mixtures generally lead to the slowest evolution of resistance [26]. However, more recently, an exploration of overlaps between agriculture and public health found that – owing to caveats and case specificity – there is only weak evidence of one IRM approach being better than another, and that the standard practice of using insecticides until resistance emerges before switching to an alternative (i.e. sequential use) may be equally effective under certain circumstances. More data, both from research and programmatic operations, are needed to compare resistance management approaches in the field [27] and to improve understanding of the biological mechanisms that are likely to favour different approaches in different situations [28][29]. Evidence-based planning To achieve optimal impact against malaria, control measures must be suitable for the geographic area (based on vector bionomics) and, well targeted and deployed at sufficient coverage. Without an evidence base or sufficient capacity to deploy interventions appropriately, resources may be used suboptimally. Given the heavy reliance on insecticidal interventions – primarily ITNs and IRS – the impacts on the environment and insecticide resistance of local vectors are key considerations in vector control planning and implementation. The inappropriate deployment of insecticides both in agriculture and in public health programmes has the potential to result in avoidable insecticide contamination of the environment and/or development of insecticide resistance of local vectors. Ideally, IRM practices should be implemented as part of routine operations, rather than waiting for resistance to spread or increase and for control failure to be suspected or confirmed. A pragmatic approach must be taken that seeks to select appropriate vector control interventions based on the insecticide resistance profile of the major malaria vectors in the target area. To outline how resistance will be monitored and managed, NMPs should develop and implement national plans in accordance with the WHO Framework for a national plan for monitoring and management of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors [23]. Detailed information on insecticide resistance monitoring methods and on how to use the data to inform the selection of appropriate interventions is provided in the revised WHO Manual for monitoring insecticide resistance in mosquito vectors and selecting appropriate interventions [22]. Further information on insecticide resistance monitoring and, more broadly, on entomological surveillance is included in the WHO Malaria surveillance, monitoring & evaluation: a reference manual, which outlines priority data across different transmission settings [30]. IRM plans should be revisited regularly to consider new information, and to integrate new interventions once they have been supported by WHO recommendations and prequalified. Vector control across different malaria transmission settings Access to effective vector control interventions will need to be maintained in the majority of countries and locations where malaria control has been effective. This includes settings with ongoing malaria transmission, as well as those in which transmission has been interrupted but in which some level of receptivity [31] and vulnerability remains. Malaria elimination is defined as the interruption of",

    "content": "control has been effective. This includes settings with ongoing malaria transmission, as well as those in which transmission has been interrupted but in which some level of receptivity [31] and vulnerability remains. Malaria elimination is defined as the interruption of local transmission (reduction to zero incidence of indigenous cases) of a specified malaria parasite species in a defined geographical area as a result of deliberate intervention activities. Following elimination, continued measures to prevent re-establishment of transmission are usually required [30]. Interventions are no longer required once eradication has been achieved. Malaria eradication is defined as the permanent reduction to zero of the worldwide incidence of infection caused by all human malaria parasite species as a result of deliberate activities.\nResidual transmission\nWHO acknowledges that malaria can persist despite high coverage of antimalarial interventions, including in areas with optimal access to and use of ITNs or with high IRS coverage [32]. This persistence of malaria transmission following the implementation in time and space of a widely effective malaria programme is referred to as residual transmission. Residual transmission occurs as a result of a combination of human and vector behaviours, for example, when people reside in or visit forest areas or do not sleep in protected houses, or when local mosquito vector species exhibit one or more behaviours that enable them to avoid vector control interventions, such as biting outside early in the evening before people have retired indoors and/or resting outdoors. The sources and risk of residual transmission may, therefore, vary by location, time and the existing components of the current malaria programme.\nIn some settings, supplementary interventions may be used in addition to ITNs or IRS to further reduce transmission. Recommendations on larviciding with chemical or biological insecticides and the use of house screening are outlined in a subsequent chapter. Supplementary interventions should be implemented in accordance with the principles outlined in the Global vector control response 2017–2030 [16].\nResidual transmission can be difficult to measure, as is the specific impact of supplementary tools on this component of ongoing transmission. Standardized methods for quantifying and characterizing this component of transmission are required in order to evaluate the effectiveness of single or combined interventions in addressing this biological challenge to malaria prevention, control and elimination.\nThere is an urgent need for greatly improved knowledge of the bionomics of the mosquitoes responsible for maintaining local transmission. New interventions and strategies should be evaluated against these vectors in order to effectively address residual transmission. While this knowledge is being gained and interventions are being developed, NMPs must prioritize the effective implementation of current interventions to reduce transmission to the lowest level possible. At the same time, they should collaborate with academic or research institutions to generate local evidence on the magnitude of the problem of residual transmission of malaria, including information on human and vector behaviours, and the effectiveness of existing and novel interventions.\nAcceptability, participation and ethical considerations\nCommunity participation in the implementation of vector control interventions often takes the form of “instruction” or “information”, with decisions about the need for interventions being made at international and national levels. Taking into account communities’ views on the recommended interventions may promote acceptance and adherence to the intervention. Increased levels of participation (e.g. consultation, inclusion and shared decision-making) should be included in the development and deployment of vector control interventions – from inception through to the planning and implementation stages.\nWHO acknowledges that appropriate policy-making often requires explicit consideration of ethical matters in addition to scientific evidence. However, the ethical issues relevant to vector-borne disease control and research have not received the analysis necessary to further improve public health programmes. Moreover, WHO Member States lack specific guidance in this area. The Seventieth World Health Assembly [33] requested the Director-General “to review and provide technical guidance on the ethical aspects and issues associated with the implementation of new vector control approaches in order to develop mitigating strategies and solutions; and to undertake a review of the ethical aspects and related issues associated with vector control implementation that include social determinants of health, in order to develop mitigating strategies and solutions to tackle health inequities.” A scoping meeting was convened by WHO to identify the ethical issues associated with vector-borne diseases [34]. Unique ethical issues associated with vector control that were identified include the ethics of coercive or mandated vector control, the deployment of insecticides (and growing vector resistance to insecticides), and research on and/or deployment of new vector control technologies. Genetically modified mosquitoes are one such innovation that presents potential challenges, including how to prevent their spread beyond the intended geographical target areas and limit potential effects on the local fauna. In 2020 WHO published guidance on vector-borne disease and ethical considerations [35]. Work is continuing to develop guidance in this area.\nEquity, gender and human rights\nWHO advocates for optimal coverage with recommended vector control interventions. As such, malaria vector control should be implemented without discrimination on the basis of age, sex, ethnicity, religion or other characteristics. In some cases, special effort is required to reach populations that are geographically isolated or adopt a nomadic lifestyle.\nResource implications and prioritization\nIn the Guidelines, resource implications and the cost-effectiveness of vector control interventions have been largely addressed by drawing on a recent systematic review of the cost and cost-effectiveness of vector control interventions [36] and expert opinion within the GDG.\nThe systematic review of the cost and cost-effectiveness of vector control interventions that was used to inform the current vector control guidelines was published in 2021, as part of a broader systematic review on the cost and cost-effectiveness of malaria control interventions, drawing on evidence published between 2005 and 2018 [36]. The body of evidence on vector control interventions was based on the use of ITNs/LLINs, IRS and larval source management (LSM) mostly in sub-Saharan African countries. The review reported that, overall, WHO-recommended malaria interventions including vector control represent value for money; however, there was great variation in the costs of intervention delivery, reflecting not only differences in the actual resource use, but also the various types of costing methodologies employed. The available cost and cost-effectiveness data focused largely on individual interventions",

    "content": "There was great variation in the costs of intervention delivery, reflecting not only differences in the actual resource use, but also the various types of costing methodologies employed. The available cost and cost-effectiveness data focused largely on individual interventions and less so on packages of interventions, which are recommended for effective malaria control. The authors reported that, due to the heterogeneity of the study contexts and the way data were presented, comparative analysis of the cost-effectiveness of interventions was not possible. The WHO Global Malaria Programme is working with partners to update the evidence review on the cost and cost-effectiveness of the vector control interventions covered in the Guidelines to support future Guideline development deliberations, for example, by building and updating a database for the cost and cost-effectiveness of vector control and other malaria interventions. It is also planned that systematic reviews commissioned in the future will include a search of the literature on both the cost and cost-effectiveness of interventions under consideration as well as those previously approved. 4.1.1 Interventions recommended for large-scale deployment. Interventions that are recommended for large-scale deployment in terms of malaria vector control are those that have proven protective efficacy to reduce or prevent infection and/or disease in humans and are broadly applicable for populations at risk of malaria in most epidemiological and ecological settings. Vector control interventions applicable for all populations at risk of malaria in most epidemiological and ecological settings are: i) deployment of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) that are prequalified by WHO, and ii) indoor residual spraying (IRS) with a product prequalified by WHO. Between 2000 and 2015, 78% of the clinical malaria cases averted was attributed to insecticidal vector control, namely through the widespread scale-up of ITNs and IRS [17]. Programmatic targets against malaria, as detailed within national strategic plans, should be used to guide the decision-making process to assemble context-appropriate intervention packages. Decision-making around the intervention mix to deploy and the coverage level of each intervention needs to consider available local data to guide the stratification of interventions, the available funding, the relative cost-effectiveness of available intervention options, the resources required to provide access within the broader context of universal health coverage (UHC), the feasibility of deploying the intervention(s) at the desired coverage level, and the country's strategic goal. The optimal coverage of the components of an intervention package for a given geographical area will also depend on other site-specific factors such as past and present transmission intensity, past and present intervention coverage, acceptability, and equity of access/use. For malaria vector control interventions recommended for large-scale deployment namely, ITNs and IRS, optimal coverage refers to providing populations at risk of malaria with access to ITNs coupled with health promotion to maximize use, and ensuring timely replacement; or providing these populations with regular application of IRS. Either intervention should be deployed at a level that provides the best value for money while reflecting programmatic realities. WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO). Insecticide-treated nets. For the ITN classes covered by WHO recommendations as interventions for use in protecting populations at risk of malaria, including in areas where malaria has been eliminated but the risk of reintroduction remains, WHO recommends products that have been prequalified by WHO. WHO Member States and their procurement partners are encouraged to draw on the list of prequalified products to inform their choice of product(s). An ITN may repel, disable and/or impact the fecundity of mosquitoes that come into contact with the insecticide on the netting material in addition to providing a physical barrier, thereby protecting the individual user. In addition, some studies have indicated that ITNs produce a 'community effect', which means that when enough ITNs are being used in a community, the survival of the mosquito population as a whole is affected; this effect increases the protection against malaria for ITN users and extends protection to members of the community who do not sleep under an ITN [37][38][39][40][41]. However, such a community effect has not been observed in all settings [42][43][44]. The WHO Global Malaria Programme commissioned a review to examine the evidence for a community effect and to investigate the biological mechanisms by which ITNs provide both personal- and community-level protection against malaria. The review also investigated what factors may determine the presence of a community effect and moderate its intensity (Lines et al unpublished evidence). The review concluded that a community effect does occur in most settings, and that its extent is driven by a number of contextual factors. These factors include vector behaviour (particularly the extent of anthropophily, i.e. the propensity to feed on people, and endophagy, i.e. the tendency of mosquitoes to blood-feed indoors); the relative availability of human and non-human hosts in the locality; the level of ITN coverage and use in a community; the insecticide used (its residual insecticidal activity and repellency); and the resistance of the local malaria vectors, both physiological and behavioural, to the insecticide on the net. The ITN coverage threshold for when the community effect becomes apparent depends on a large number of contextual factors. Regardless of the context-dependent starting threshold, the extent of the community-level protection increases as ITN coverage and net use in a given community increases. Because ITNs kill insecticide-susceptible mosquitoes that come into contact with the insecticide on the netting material, more mosquitoes will be killed as ITN coverage increases. This killing effect reduces both mosquito population density and mosquito longevity, resulting in fewer malaria vectors overall and a lower infectivity rate as fewer mosquitoes will survive the time it takes for the malaria parasite to develop in the mosquito. Consequently, the reduced density, age and proportion of the local mosquito population that is infective offer an additional level of protection to the whole community beyond the individual protection provided by ITNs. Large-scale field trials [41][45] and transmission models [46][47] originally suggested that community coverage (i.e. the proportion of human population using an ITN with effective insecticide treatments each night) of ≥ 50% is expected to result in some level of community-wide protection. The WHO-commissioned review indicated that this area-wide protection may start to occur at lower coverage levels (Lines et al unpublished evidence). The review modelled the short-term effect of increasing ITN coverage on the EIR (infectious bites per person per year) in an area with high malaria transmission and an insecticide-susceptible, anthropophilic vector, assuming fixed human infectiousness. In the coverage range of 15% to 85%, an additional 20% increase in coverage of the",

The review modelled the short-term effect of increasing ITN coverage on the EIR (infectious bites per person per year) in an area with high malaria transmission and an insecticide-susceptible, anthropophilic vector, assuming fixed human infectiousness. In the coverage range of 15% to 85%, an additional 20% increase in coverage of the human population at risk would result in a reduction in malaria transmission intensity of approximately 50% (these findings are taken from the report submitted to WHO; findings may be revised if indicated by peer review). Additional ITN coverage is always beneficial in terms of providing more protection to individuals – both users and non-users of ITNs – and, conversely, any reduction in coverage may result in increased malaria transmission. However, there may be diminishing marginal returns to increasing coverage at higher levels. In terms of absolute cases of malaria averted, a reduction in malaria transmission when increasing ITN coverage from 80% to 100% may not generate the same impact as a 20% increase in coverage at lower levels of coverage; the marginal costs required to increase coverage at high levels (>80%) will also increase due to growing system inefficiencies. At the country level, these diminishing returns must be balanced against potential investments in other cost-effective malaria prevention and control activities by means of a well-informed prioritization process. Three main ITN classes are recognized by WHO. With the March 2023 update to the guidelines, these classes are: • ITNs designed to kill host-seeking insecticide-susceptible mosquito populations that have demonstrated public health value compared to untreated nets and whose entomological effects consist of killing and reducing the blood-feeding of insecticide-susceptible mosquito vectors. This intervention class covers pyrethroid-only nets prequalified by WHO and conventionally treated nets that rely on periodic re-treatment with a WHO prequalified self-treatment kit. Public health value has been demonstrated for products within this class and WHO recommends use of pyrethroid-only LLINs prequalified by WHO for large-scale deployment. • ITNs designed to kill host-seeking insecticide-resistant mosquitoes and for which a first-in-class product demonstrates public health value compared to the epidemiological impact of pyrethroid-only nets. This class includes nets that are treated with a pyrethroid insecticide and a synergist such as piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and nets treated with insecticides other than pyrethroid-based formulations. Public health value has been demonstrated for this class and WHO has issued recommendations for deployment of pyrethroid-PBO nets and for pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr nets in areas with pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes. WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) 42 of 478 --- Page Break --- • ITNs designed to sterilize and/or reduce the fecundity of host-seeking insecticide-resistant mosquitoes for which a first-in-class product demonstrates public health value compared to the epidemiological impact of pyrethroid-only nets. Nets treated with pyrethroid + pyriproxyfen (an insect growth regulator), which fall into this class, are now conditionally recommended for deployment instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs. ITNs are most effective where the principal malaria vector(s) mosquitoes bite predominantly at night after people have retired under their nets. ITNs can be used both indoors and outdoors, wherever they can be suitably hung (although hanging nets in direct sunlight should be avoided, as sunlight can affect insecticidal activity). Residual surface treatment (RST) is the application of insecticides with residual activity to surfaces where malaria mosquito vectors may rest such as walls and ceilings, with the aim of killing the mosquitoes that potentially transmit malaria. RST conceptually includes indoor and outdoor applications and may be delivered through several approaches, such as spraying, applying insecticidal paints or installing wall linings. It can be applied to all surfaces or to select areas where mosquitoes are more likely to rest. IRS is a procedure commonly used in many malaria programmes for malaria control. ITNs and IRS interventions have been credited for the large reductions in malaria seen globally between 2000 and 2015 [17]. IRS involves the spraying of internal walls, eaves and ceilings of structures (including domestic animal shelters), where resting malaria vectors are likely to come into contact with the insecticide. Indoor residual surface treatment (IRST) captures the current use pattern of IRS for malaria vector control and could potentially include other application methods as detailed above. To date, no insecticidal paint or wall lining products have been prequalified by WHO, and partial wall treatments have not been comprehensively evaluated in terms of their epidemiological impact compared to full wall treatment. It is envisaged that the IRS recommendation in the WHO Guidelines for malaria will evolve; however, any change will be based on the submission and assessment of data on other forms of RST. IRS is most effective where the vector population is susceptible to the insecticide(s) being applied, where the majority of mosquitoes feed and rest indoors, and where most structures are suitable for spraying. When deciding whether to deploy IRS, programmes should assess these variables and consider whether achieving the target coverage of IRS is feasible. Humanitarian emergencies. The first priorities for malaria control in humanitarian emergencies are prompt and effective diagnosis and treatment [48]. While deployment of ITNs and IRS has been shown to provide protection against malaria in the limited number of studies that have been carried out in the chronic phase of emergencies [49][50][51][52][53][54][55] (Messenger et al unpublished evidence), it should be recognized that deployment of such interventions may be logistically challenging during the acute phase of a humanitarian emergency. In the following sections, recommendations regarding the deployment of ITNs and IRS are provided. Some vector control interventions and personal protection measures have been developed specifically for deployment in emergency situations. Such interventions include insecticide-treated plastic sheeting (ITPS) or tarpaulins, which can be used to construct temporary shelters, and insecticide-impregnated blankets or topsheets, used to protect people sleeping at night. Such items may be included in emergency relief kits provided at the outset of an emergency. Additionally, the use of repellents and treating peridomestic animals (such as cattle) with insecticides could support efforts to protect the population. However, a limited number of studies have evaluated the effectiveness of these interventions in humanitarian emergencies [55] (Messenger et al unpublished evidence), so the evidence base on their effectiveness against malaria is currently insufficient to formulate recommendations. In humanitarian emergencies, further consideration must be given to whether the delivery of vector control interventions is feasible. This may depend on: • the type of shelter available (e.g. ad hoc refuse materials, plastic sheeting, tents, more permanent housing)",

    "content": "Recommendations. In humanitarian emergencies, further consideration must be given to whether the delivery of vector control interventions is feasible. This may depend on:\n• The type of shelter available (e.g. ad hoc refuse materials, plastic sheeting, tents, more permanent housing).\n• The available infrastructure, resources and human capacity to deliver vector control; and\n• Engaging with community leaders and educating the population about the benefits of vector control, to enhance acceptance and cooperation.\nPractical info: The current WHO recommendation for ITNs applies only to those mosquito nets that have been prequalified by WHO and that contain only an insecticide of the pyrethroid class (categorized as ‘pyrethroid-only LLINs’). As with all insecticide-based interventions, the insecticide resistance profile of the vectors within the area of deployment should be assessed. If pyrethroid-resistance is detected, pyrethroid-PBO ITN or pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs should be considered for distribution, and pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs may be considered, instead of pyrethroid-only nets (see the following recommendations on the other types of nets).\nITNs are generally acceptable to most communities. In many malaria-endemic countries, untreated nets were in use for many years prior to the introduction of ITNs and, even where there is not a long history of their use, they have become familiar tools for preventing mosquito bites. Individuals often appreciate the extra privacy afforded by a net, as well as its effectiveness in controlling other nuisance insects. In very hot climates, ITNs may be less acceptable, as they are perceived to reduce air flow, making it too hot to allow for a comfortable sleep. In areas where mosquito densities are low or where malaria transmission is low, individuals and communities may perceive less benefit to using nets.\nWhen deploying ITNs, coverage must be optimized such that both personal and community-level effects are maximized and maintained in endemic settings. Post-distribution monitoring of nets is essential, reporting their durability, usage and coverage. Evaluation of the impact on vectors, such as their abundance, EIR and behaviour, and insecticide resistance status can be used to inform and guide future deployment.\nNets should be handled and disposed of appropriately to minimize risk to human and animal health and of environmental contamination. WHO recommends that old nets are not burned in the open air but are buried, preferably in non-permeable soil and away from water sources. Burning may lead to the release of dioxins, which are harmful to human health. The insecticides used on nets are toxic to aquatic organisms and so should not be disposed of in water.\nEvidence to decision: Strong recommendation for, High certainty evidence: Pyrethroid-only nets (2019). Pyrethroid-only long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) should be deployed for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults living in areas with ongoing malaria transmission.\n• WHO recommends ITNs that have been prequalified by WHO for deployment in protecting populations at risk of malaria.\n• ITNs are most effective where the principal malaria vector(s) bite predominantly at night after people have retired under their nets.\n• ITNs can be used both indoors and outdoors, wherever they can be suitably hung (though hanging nets in direct sunlight should be avoided, as sunlight can affect insecticidal activity).\nBenefits and harms: The systematic review [56] reported that, compared to no nets, ITNs significantly reduce:\n• All-cause child mortality (rate ratio: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.77–0.89; high-certainty evidence).\n• Incidence of P. falciparum malaria (rate ratio: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.48–0.64; high-certainty evidence).\n• Prevalence of P. falciparum malaria (risk ratio: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.71–0.98; high-certainty evidence), and\n• Incidence of severe malaria disease (rate ratio: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.38–0.82; high-certainty evidence).\nNo undesirable effects were identified in the systematic review. However, the panel noted that brand new nets recently removed from packaging may cause slight, transitory irritation to skin, eyes, nose, etc. Some users complain that the nets are too hot to sleep under, especially during the warmer seasons. As with any insecticide-based intervention, ITNs may also play a role in insecticide resistance development in Anopheles vectors, and there is a risk of environmental contamination with potential toxic effects on animals if nets are not handled or disposed of carefully (see section on Practical Info).\nHigh Certainty of the evidence: The systematic review [56] determined that, overall, the certainty of the evidence that ITNs have an impact on malaria was high compared to no nets and compared to untreated nets.\nResources and other considerations: The list below, compiled by the GDG, indicates resources that should be considered for the deployment of ITNs. Note that the list does not include resource needs for product selection or assessment of impact of the intervention.\n• Staff: Competent, trained, supervised and adequately remunerated enumerators; Transport logisticians and drivers; Stock managers; Distribution team staff (including those trained in behaviour change communication [BCC]); Teachers/health facility staff, where appropriate, trained for distribution channel; Entomologists for quality control (QC) assessments; Environmental assessment support staff.\n• Training: Training in enumeration, distribution, logistics management, BCC, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and quality assurance assessments.\n• Transport: Shipping of ITNs may require large trucks for transport of containerized nets from port of entry to centralized warehouses and onward to the district or other level; Vehicles to provide transport of ITNs and potentially distributors to the community (last mile) to enumerate persons/households, provide BCC and distribute ITNs; Vehicle maintenance costs; Fuel.\n• Supplies: ITNs; Inventory management forms; Lists of recipient households and numbers of residents, distribution forms, including sign-off sheets for receipt of nets by staff for distribution and for delivery to recipients, daily distribution reports, inventory status reports, recipient status reports, and BCC materials (e.g. flip charts, posters, banners, staff clothing); M&E data collection forms; ITN quality/durability assessment materials – e.g. cone bioassay material.\n• Equipment: Computer and communication equipment.\n• Infrastructure: Appropriate national and regional storage; Adequate lower level storage for ITNs at the district/ school/health facility; Office space for management; Insectary to maintain mosquitoes exposed in QC assessments.\n• Communication: Communication with other ministries and sectors e.g. environment, transport; Communication with the general public, e.g. through the education sector and advertising on local media to encourage uptake and appropriate use and care of ITNs; Communication with the community/local leaders.\n• Governance/programme management: Distribution supervisors; BCC supervision; M&E survey support for assessing coverage and use.",

ITNs may also reduce the prevalence of P. vivax, but here the evidence of an effect was less certain. Compared to untreated nets, there was high certainty evidence that ITNs reduce the rate of uncomplicated episodes of P. falciparum and reduce the prevalence of P. falciparum. There was moderate certainty evidence that ITNs also reduce all-cause child mortality compared to untreated nets. The effects on the incidence of uncomplicated P. vivax episodes and P. vivax prevalence were less clear.\nThe systematic review did not identify any undesirable effects of pyrethroid ITNs.\n\nResearch needs\n• Determine the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection), as well as potential harms and/or unintended consequences of new types of nets and insecticides in areas where resistance to pyrethroids is high.\n• Determine the durability of different pyrethroid-only nets over the replenishment cycle of ITNs in field settings (generally three years or more).\n• Determine the effectiveness of nets in situations of residual/outdoor transmission.\n• Determine the impact of ITNs in transmission ‘hotspots’ and elimination settings.\n\nPractical info\nGiven that the evidence indicates that unwashed pyrethroid-PBO ITNs are more effective than pyrethroid-only LLINs in areas with pyrethroid resistance up to 25 months post-deployment, the decision on whether to switch from pyrethroid-only LLINs to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, or another ITN product designed to provide enhanced efficacy in areas of pyrethroid resistance, should be guided by resource availability. WHO recommends that pyrethroid-PBO ITNs be used where pyrethroid resistance is confirmed. QC supervision.\nConditional recommendation for, Moderate certainty evidence: Pyrethroid-PBO ITNs (2022).\nPyrethroid-PBO ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs can be deployed for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission where the principal malaria vector(s) exhibit pyrethroid resistance.\nThe conditionality of this recommendation is driven by the current higher unit cost of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs and therefore the uncertainty of their affordability in different settings. Furthermore, as PBO is less wash-resistant than pyrethroids, its bioavailability declines faster over the three-year estimated life of an ITN; therefore, the added impact of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs over that of pyrethroid-only LLINs may decline over time. The evidence comes from two sites in eastern Africa with pyrethroid resistance and not from other geographies where transmission levels and vector characteristics may vary. PBO acts by inhibiting certain metabolic enzymes, primarily oxidases, and so are likely to provide greater protection than pyrethroid-only LLINs where mosquitoes display mono-oxygenase-based insecticide resistance mechanisms.\nIn deciding whether pyrethroid-PBO ITNs may be appropriate in their context, malaria programmes should:\n• consider the deployment of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs in areas where resistance to pyrethroids in local vectors has been detected;\n• determine whether resources are adequate to cover the extra cost of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, while ensuring that coverage of populations at risk of malaria is not affected;\n• note that WHO recommends that ITNs prequalified by WHO be selected for deployment.\nWHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO)\n46 of 478\n\nusing standard procedures [22]. Given that pyrethroid-PBO nets are designed to provide improved impact against resistant mosquitoes in which pyrethroid resistance is, at least in part, conferred by a monooxygenase-based resistance mechanism, determining the presence of such resistance mechanisms in local vector populations will provide additional information to help target deployment. In deciding whether to use potentially more expensive pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, malaria programmes should consider the impact this switch may have on vector control coverage. Deployment of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs must only be considered in situations where coverage with effective vector control (primarily ITNs or IRS) will not be reduced. The primary goal must be to ensure continued access and use of ITNs or IRS at levels that ensure optimal coverage for all people at risk of malaria as part of an intervention package. Post-distribution monitoring of nets to estimate coverage in terms of access to and use of nets and other malaria interventions is recommended. Pyrethroid-PBO ITNs should not be considered a tool that can alone effectively manage insecticide resistance in malaria vectors. Despite the recent recommendation of other ITN classes and associated product, the development and evaluation of ITNs treated with non-pyrethroid insecticides and other innovative vector control interventions for deployment across all settings continues to remain a priority to provide alternatives for use in a comprehensive IRM strategy. The systematic review reported that the washing of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs may result in lower mosquito mortality and higher blood-feeding success than the washing of pyrethroid-only LLINs. The durability of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs has been questioned previously based on wash-resistance data. The added epidemiological and entomological impact of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs depends on the bioavailability and retention of PBO on/in the net. If this is reduced significantly over time and/or declines with washing, the greater impact of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs over pyrethroid-only LLINs in terms of protection against malaria may be limited to less than three years. As part of M&E activities, data collected by programmes on net durability would provide information on the life span of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs under field conditions and hence on the period over which the additional impact is maintained. Programmes that decide to switch from pyrethroid-only LLINs to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs based on concerns regarding continued effectiveness and/or insecticide resistance status of local vectors, should not revert back to the use of pyrethroid-only LLINs.",

Programmes that decide to switch from pyrethroid-only LLINs to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs based on concerns regarding continued effectiveness and/or insecticide resistance status of local vectors, should not revert back to the use of pyrethroid-only LLINs thereafter. Instead, programmes should plan for continued deployment of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs in that geographic area or develop plans for deployment of other equally or more effective new interventions once these are covered by a WHO recommendation. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms The systematic review [57] included two trials [58][59] from the United Republic of Tanzania and the Republic of Uganda that compared the epidemiological impact of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs against malaria to that of pyrethroid-only LLINs. Both trials were conducted in areas with highly pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes, defined by the review team as mosquitoes demonstrating <30% mortality in discriminating dose assays. The review provided high- to moderate-certainty evidence that malaria parasite prevalence was lower where pyrethroid-PBO nets were deployed at four time points post net distribution, being: • 4–6 months: OR: 0.74 (95% CI: 0.62–0.89), • 9–12 months: OR: 0.72 (95% CI: 0.61–0.86), • 16–18 months: OR: 0.88 (95% CI: 0.74–1.04), and • 21–25 months: OR: 0.79 (95% CI: 0.67–0.95). The review also reported entomological outcomes, mosquito mortality and mosquito blood-feeding success derived from experimental hut studies. In areas classified by the authors as having highly pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes, unwashed pyrethroid-PBO ITNs were found to result in higher mosquito mortality and lower blood-feeding success compared to unwashed pyrethroid-only LLINs. Comparing washed pyrethroid-PBO ITNs to washed pyrethroid-only LLINs, however, the review reported that it was unclear whether the washed pyrethroid-PBO ITNs had a greater effect on mosquito mortality, although the washed pyrethroid-PBO ITNs did decrease the blood-feeding success of mosquitoes. In areas defined as having moderate, low (defined by the review team as 31–60% and 61–90% mosquito mortality, respectively, in discriminating dose assays) or no pyrethroid insecticide resistance, the review did not identify any studies with epidemiological outcomes. Regarding entomological outcomes, mosquito mortality was only shown to be higher with unwashed pyrethroid-PBO ITNs compared to unwashed pyrethroid-only LLINs in those areas with moderate insecticide resistance. Little or no difference was seen in terms of mosquito mortality or blood-feeding rates when washed or unwashed pyrethroid-PBO ITNs were used in areas with low or no resistance compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs. Given that the systematic review was limited to two studies with malaria outcomes, a number of potential effect modifiers could not be examined. However, as with pyrethroid-only LLINs, the GDG concluded that the extent of the impact of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs is likely to vary in different settings and will depend on a number of factors, such as the behaviour of the main malaria vectors and their level and mechanism(s) of insecticide resistance, the parasite prevalence in that area, and the usage of nets within a community. The systematic review did not report any harms or unintended consequences of the intervention. However, the GDG noted that, compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs, pyrethroid-PBO ITNs may play an as yet unknown role in the development of insecticide resistance in Anopheles mosquito vectors, such as increasing selection pressure for non-oxygenase resistance mechanisms or perhaps increasing the intensity of oxygenase resistance. In the absence of empirical evidence, this potential undesirable effect was judged to be small. Moderate Certainty of the evidence The systematic review assessed that the overall certainty of evidence was moderate regarding the effectiveness of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs compared with pyrethroid-only LLINs. Values and preferences No research was identified regarding preferences and values. The GDG judged that there was probably no important uncertainty or variability. Resources Similar resources, other than the cost of the ITN itself, are needed for the deployment of the different ITN products that are now available within the WHO recommended classes. (See table provided under “Resources and other considerations” for pyrethroid-only ITNs.) Based on the available cost data, the GDG judged that there are currently additional costs associated with deploying pyrethroid-PBO and other types of ITNs over pyrethroid-only LLINs. Due to the likely scale of ITN deployment, any additional cost per net would amount to a considerable additional budget associated with a switch away from pyrethroid-only LLINs, which would need to be met in order to maintain coverage. The GDG, however, remarked that unit costs change over time and, as they do, a review will be needed to determine whether this cost discrepancy remains. National programmes are encouraged to pay specific attention to the commodity cost, as this will also vary depending on required quantities and lead-times and will be a key ingredient to the separately developed guidance on ITN prioritization. Apart from the higher cost of the net, the GDG identified no additional resource requirements associated with a switch from pyrethroid-only LLINs to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. Based on experience to date, pyrethroid-PBO ITNs require similar resources to those identified for the distribution of pyrethroid-only LLINs (see table provided under “Resources and other considerations” for pyrethroid-only LLINs). It would be necessary to assess the insecticide resistance status in the principal vector(s) in the area where deployment is planned in order to determine whether pyrethroid resistance is present and thus to justify such deployment. However, regular insecticide resistance testing by means of bioassays should form part of routine programme monitoring operations and therefore should already be part of the budget. Further information justifying the use of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs could be generated using standard WHO procedures [22] to determine if a monooxygenase-based mechanism is at least partially involved in conferring pyrethroid resistance. The systematic review reported that cost-effectiveness analyses comparing pyrethroid-PBO ITNs and pyrethroid-only LLINs are currently not available [57]. The GDG concluded that the cost-effectiveness of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs may vary. In areas of pyrethroid resistance, pyrethroid-PBO ITNs may have greater impact on malaria than pyrethroid-only LLINs during the period for which the PBO is bioavailable. However, PBO is less wash-resistant than pyrethroids and its bioavailability therefore declines faster over the three-year estimated life of an ITN. The added impact of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs over that of pyrethroid-only LLINs may be lost or decline considerably over time. Justification Pyrethroid-PBO ITNs combine pyrethroids and a synergist, which acts by inhibiting certain metabolic enzymes, primarily oxidases, within the mosquito that would otherwise detoxify or sequester insecticides before they could reach their target site in an insect.",

    "content": "Justification\nPyrethroid-PBO ITNs combine pyrethroids and a synergist, which acts by inhibiting certain metabolic enzymes, primarily oxidases, within the mosquito that would otherwise detoxify or sequester insecticides before they could reach their target site in an insect. Therefore, compared to a pyrethroid-only LLIN, a pyrethroid-PBO ITN should have an increased killing effect on malaria vectors that express elevated oxidases, which is commonly associated with pyrethroid resistance.\nThe systematic review [57] identified and included two trials [58][59], both from eastern Africa, evaluating parasite prevalence in areas where pyrethroid-PBO ITNs were deployed compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs. Both trials were conducted in areas with highly pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes, defined by the review team as mosquitoes demonstrating <30% mortality in discriminating dose assays. Parasite prevalence was reduced by approximately 20% up to 25 months after distribution. The Tanzanian trial has been extended further to establish whether this effect lasts the full duration of an LLIN's intended lifespan, but results are not yet publicly available.\nAlthough the two epidemiological trials included in the review were from areas where pyrethroid resistance was determined to be high, the methods used by the authors to determine the level of resistance and the categorization of the different bands of resistance intensity were not consistent with those recommended by WHO [22]. In many parts of Africa, as well as other parts of the world, pyrethroid resistance is becoming more prevalent and is generally increasing in intensity in the presence of continued selection pressure [3]. The panel therefore concluded that pyrethroid-PBO ITNs are likely to offer greater protection against malaria than pyrethroid-only LLINs in most areas where pyrethroid resistance is detected and mediated by elevated oxidases, regardless of resistance intensity.\nWhen moving from the evidence provided to a decision on the strength of the recommendation, the GDG concluded that the recommendation should be conditional rather than strong for this intervention. In the context of guideline development, a conditional recommendation reflects that the GDG concludes that the desirable effects of adhering to the recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, but the panel is not confident about these trade-offs. The conditionality of this recommendation was based on the fact that the available evidence was only from African sites with pyrethroid resistance, rather than from other geographies; the moderate additional benefit of deploying pyrethroid-PBO ITNs compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs; the overall moderate certainty of the results; the higher unit cost of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs; and the uncertainty of cost-effectiveness.\nResearch needs\nWHO encourages additional high-quality research to generate further evidence on:\n• the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended\nIn addition to the issue of durability, the cost-effectiveness may also depend on a number of potential effect modifiers, such as the malaria transmission level and vector characteristics in an area. Lastly, the GDG was concerned that, given flatlined funding for malaria [3], the procurement of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs may negatively impact programmes’ ability to maintain ITN coverage of at-risk populations. Due to the current moderately higher cost of this commodity, there is a risk that existing net coverage could not be maintained if no additional funds were made available to cover the additional expenditure required to purchase the same quantity of nets as previously deployed.\nEquity The impact on the equity of using pyrethroid-PBO ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs was judged to vary by the GDG. If switching to more costly pyrethroid-PBO ITNs resulted in lower coverage of those at risk of contracting malaria with preventive tools, equity would likely be reduced. However, if the switch resulted in no reduction in coverage and those populations who were previously provided with pyrethroid-only LLINs were then protected against malaria by a slightly more effective intervention, equity would likely increase.\nAcceptability No research was identified regarding the acceptability of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. However, the GDG judged that such nets would be equally acceptable to key stakeholders, given that they are by-and-large physically the same as and used similarly to pyrethroid-only LLINs.\nFeasibility No research was identified regarding the feasibility of implementing pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. Nevertheless, the GDG judged that distributing such nets would be equally feasible as for pyrethroid-only LLINs.\nconsequences of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs in areas where the mechanisms of resistance in vector species are not oxidase-based and in areas of lower malaria transmission intensity;\n• contextual factors (e.g. acceptability, feasibility, resource use, cost-effectiveness, equity, values and preferences) related to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs;\n• the durability of different pyrethroid-PBO nets over the replenishment cycle of ITNs in field settings (generally three years or more).\nEvidence to decision\nPractical info\nGiven that pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs are designed to provide improved impact against insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, pyrethroid resistance in potential target areas should be confirmed using standard procedures [22], as should the susceptibility of local vectors to chlorfenapyr.

    "content": "Pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs vs pyrethroid-PBO ITNs (2023). Pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs can be deployed instead of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs for prevention of malaria in adults and children in areas with pyrethroid resistance. The conditionality of the recommendation to deploy pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs instead of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs is based on the GDG’s judgement that the balance of desirable and undesirable effects probably favours pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs over pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. However, the evidence for this recommendation is from only one trial in Africa. In deciding whether to deploy pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, malaria programmes should: determine whether resources are adequate to cover the extra costs compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, while ensuring optimal coverage of populations at risk of malaria; generate additional information or conduct analyses with the aim of maximizing impact through targeted deployment (e.g. stratification of malaria risk, assessment of the characteristics of local vectors, such as pyrethroid resistance mechanisms). ITNs for prevention of malaria in adults and children in areas with pyrethroid resistance; and note that WHO recommends that ITNs prequalified by WHO be selected for deployment. Studies on integrity should be conducted each time a campaign uses a new product such as pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs. Such studies will provide information on the product’s life span under field conditions and thus enable estimation of the period over which the additional impact against malaria may be maintained. The systematic review reported that, two years after deployment, 34% of pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs were torn (defined as hole area ≥ 790 cm²) and therefore not fit for use, compared to 28% of pyrethroid-only LLINs and 43% of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. Evidence to decision. Benefits and harms: Given that the systematic review [Barker et al unpublished evidence] was limited to two studies with malaria outcomes, a number of potential effect modifiers could not be examined. The GDG concluded that the extent of the impact of pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs is likely to vary by setting and will depend on several factors such as intensity of malaria transmission, behaviour of the main malaria vectors, the level and mechanism(s) of insecticide resistance, and the usage of ITNs within a community. The GDG also noted that both the type and dosage of pyrethroid on the pyrethroid-only LLINs and on pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs (alphacypermethrin) differed from those on the pyrethroid-PBO ITNs (permethrin), and this may influence the impact against malaria. Furthermore, the GDG observed that the resistance mechanism of the vector population at the study site was not reported. If the pyrethroid resistance in the study was not due to P450-based mechanisms, the effect of the pyrethroid-PBO ITNs may have been underestimated, as these nets would not have offered the same level of protection than in areas where resistance is conferred, at least partly, by P450-based mechanisms. The systematic review reported [Barker et al unpublished evidence] that one trial [60] recorded 90 (44.1%) adverse events in the group assigned to the pyrethroid-only LLINs, 17 (8.5%) in the pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITN group and 17 (8.5%) in the pyrethroid-PBO ITN group. The authors also narratively reported that skin irritation was the most commonly reported adverse event; however, no adverse event was assessed as serious. While five deaths were reported in the cohort, three of these were from drowning, one was due to severe malaria and one to pneumonia; all of these deaths were judged to be unrelated to the study interventions. The review also reported data on ITN integrity from the United Republic of Tanzania [60]. The numbers (proportion) of torn ITNs (defined as hole area ≥ 790 cm² and therefore not serviceable) were reported as 86 (28%) in the pyrethroid-only LLIN group, 96 (34%) in the pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITN group and 81 (43%) in the pyrethroid-PBO ITN group. The GDG noted that, compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs, pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs may exert an as yet unknown selection pressure for the development of resistance to pyrrole insecticides and non-oxygenase resistance mechanisms in Anopheles mosquito vectors. Overall, the GDG judged that the extent of undesirable effects associated with pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs was small compared to either pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs and that the overall balance of effects probably favours pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs. Moderate Certainty of the evidence: Based on the systematic review [Barker et al unpublished evidence], the GDG concluded that the overall certainty of evidence that pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs have an impact against malaria was moderate. Values and preferences: No research was identified regarding preferences and values. The GDG judged that there was probably no important uncertainty or variability associated with pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs. Resources: Similar resources, other than commodity costs, would be needed for the deployment of pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs as those listed for pyrethroid-only LLINs. (See table provided under “Resources and other considerations” for pyrethroid-only LLINs.) Based on the cost data reported by the study in the United Republic of Tanzania [60], pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs were estimated to cost US$ 3.02 per ITN, while pyrethroid-only LLINs and pyrethroid-PBO ITNs were estimated to cost US$ 2.07 and US$ 2.98 per ITN, respectively. Based on these data, the GDG judged that there are currently moderate additional costs associated with deploying pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs. Due to the scale of existing ITN coverage, the moderate additional cost per ITN could amount to considerable additional costs associated with a switch from pyrethroid-only LLINs to pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs, which would need to be met in order to maintain the same population coverage. The GDG, however, remarked that unit costs change over time and often decrease as new technologies are brought to scale. As pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs are scaled up, further review will be needed to determine whether this cost difference remains. National programmes are encouraged to pay specific attention to the commodity cost, as this will also vary depending on required quantities and lead-times and will be a key ingredient to the separately developed guidance on ITN prioritization. Insecticide resistance status of the principal vector(s) in the area where deployment is planned should be assessed to justify deployment of pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr nets. However, regular insecticide resistance testing by means of bioassays [22] should already be part of routine monitoring operations and programme budgets. The systematic review reported that the study conducted in the United Republic of Tanzania [60] carried out cost-effectiveness analyses that compared pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs and pyrethroid-PBO ITNs to pyrethroid-only LLINs over the two-year period of the trial. Pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs were estimated.",

    "content": "programme budgets.\nThe systematic review reported that the study conducted in the United Republic of Tanzania [60] carried out cost-effectiveness analyses that compared pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs and pyrethroid-PBO ITNs to pyrethroid-only LLINs over the two-year period of the trial. Pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs were estimated to avert 152 DALYs [SD 72] per 10 000 total population, while pyrethroid-PBO ITNs averted 37 DALYs [SD 72] per 10 000 population. When considering the costs of malaria diagnosis and treatment, pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs were reported to be less costly (incremental cost US$ 2894 [SD 1129] per 10 000 population) than pyrethroid-PBO ITNs (US$ 4816 [SD 1360]) from all perspectives. From societal and household perspectives, pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs would be more effective and less costly than either pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs over a two-year period. The GDG concluded that the cost-effectiveness would probably favour pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs over pyrethroid-only LLINs and pyrethroid-PBO ITNs.\nThe GDG was concerned that, given flatlined funding for malaria [3], the procurement of pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs may negatively impact the ability of programmes to maintain ITN coverage of at-risk populations. Due to the current moderately higher cost of this commodity, there is a risk that programmes may not be able to maintain existing ITN coverage or coverage of other malaria interventions if no additional funds to cover the higher costs are made available. Some pragmatic prioritization guidance [61] has been provided with a view to supporting programmes in decision-making around the deployment of new types of nets in resource-constrained environments.\nEquity The GDG judged that the impact on the equity of using pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs is variable. If switching from pyrethroid-only LLINs to more costly pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs would result in lower coverage of preventive interventions for those at risk of malaria, equity may be reduced. However, if the switch resulted in no reduction in coverage (due to increased funding or price reduction) and those populations who were previously provided with pyrethroid-only LLINs were then protected from malaria by a more effective intervention, equity would likely increase.\nAcceptability No research was identified regarding the acceptability of pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs. However, the GDG judged that such ITNs would be acceptable to key stakeholders, given that they are largely similar to pyrethroid-only LLINs and pyrethroid-PBO ITNs in terms of their appearance, design and use, and given that they are currently available at a cost similar to that of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs.\nFeasibility Although no research was identified regarding the feasibility of implementing pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs, the GDG judged that deploying these ITNs would be as feasible as deploying pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs.\nWHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO)\n52 of 478\nJustification\nPyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs combine two active ingredients: a pyrethroid and a pyrrole insecticide. They are designed to kill mosquitoes that are resistant to pyrethroids and, as such, fall into the second class of ITNs recognized by WHO. Pyrrole insecticides such as chlorfenapyr disrupt adenosine 5'-triphosphate production in the mosquito’s mitochondria, thereby reducing the target insects' ability to produce energy and leading to cell dysfunction and subsequent death. Pyrethroids, meanwhile, target voltage-gated sodium channels associated with the nervous system of the insect, which results in muscular paralysis and rapid death. Due to its different mode of action, chlorfenapyr is, therefore, unlikely to show any cross-resistance to standard neurotoxic insecticides such as pyrethroids. Furthermore, death of the insect may occur 24–48 hours after exposure to chlorfenapyr, in contrast to pyrethroids, which result in a more rapid kill. The different entomological mode and site of action of chlorfenapyr may reduce selection pressure for insecticide resistance. By including two active ingredients in an ITN, the likelihood of the mosquitoes being resistant to both is greatly reduced. Therefore, compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs should have an increased killing effect against pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors and thus a greater impact against malaria.\nThe systematic review [Barker et al unpublished evidence] identified and included two trials [60][62] from eastern and western Africa evaluating the impact of pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs on incidence of clinical malaria and prevalence of malaria infection, compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. Both trials were conducted in areas with high malaria transmission (malaria infection prevalence in children under 10 years of age recorded as 20–40%) and pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes. Compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs, incidence of clinical malaria (defined as malaria symptoms, i.e. current fever with a temperature ≥ 37.5°C or fever in the past 48 hours, plus malaria parasitaemia) was reduced by approximately 55% one year after deployment of pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs and by 40% two years post-deployment. Prevalence of malaria infection (regardless of symptoms) was reduced by approximately 20% one year after deployment and by approximately 45% two years post-deployment. Compared to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs had little or no effect on incidence of clinical malaria one year after their deployment. However, after two years, incidence was reduced by 35%. Prevalence of malaria infection was reduced by approximately 20% one year post-deployment and by 30% two years post-deployment. The trials in Benin and in the United Republic of Tanzania will investigate the impact against malaria over 36-month, which aligns with the replenishment cycle of ITNs in most field settings. Results are not available yet.\nWhen moving from the evidence provided by the systematic review to a decision as to the strength of the recommendation, the GDG concluded that there should be a strong recommendation to deploy pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs in areas where malaria vectors are resistant to pyrethroids. This was due to the large effect against malaria and the high certainty that the benefits of deploying pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs would outweigh any harms. However, the panel concluded that the recommendation to deploy pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs instead of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs in areas of insecticide resistance should be conditional. This was based on the fact that the available evidence was from only one trial in the United Republic of Tanzania, where intensity of malaria transmission is high and An. funestus is the primary malaria vector, which in turn limits generalizability of the findings to other geographies with different anopheline vectors and eco-epidemiological characteristics. Furthermore, deploying pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr ITNs was associated with a moderate additional benefit compared to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs two years after ITN deployment, but with little or no difference in malaria outcomes one year after deployment.\nResearch needs",

In any case, pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs should not be considered a tool that alone can effectively manage insecticide resistance in malaria vectors.\nConditional recommendation for, Moderate certainty evidence\nPyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs vs pyrethroid-only LLINs (2023)\nPyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs can be deployed instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs for prevention of malaria in adults and children in areas with pyrethroid resistance.\nThe conditionality of the recommendation to deploy pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs is based on the GDG’s concerns that the available evidence indicates poor cost-effectiveness of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs. Poor cost-effectiveness is a result of both the higher cost compared to a pyrethroid-only net, which would require extra resources to maintain the same coverage, and the relatively short-lived (12 months) additional impact obtained by deploying pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen nets over pyrethroid-only nets.\nIn deciding whether pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs should be deployed instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs, malaria programmes should:\n• determine whether resources are adequate to cover the extra cost compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs, while ensuring optimal coverage of populations at risk of malaria;\n• generate additional information or conduct analyses with the aim of maximizing impact through targeted deployment (e.g. stratification of malaria risk, assessment of the characteristics of local vectors, such as pyrethroid resistance mechanisms); and\n• note that WHO recommends that ITNs prequalified by WHO be selected for deployment.\nNote: Recommendations on deployment of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen nets were separated into two distinct recommendations for better clarity, but share the same evidence to decision, justification, practical info and research needs. Please refer to the following section.\nModerate Certainty of the evidence\nBased on the systematic review, the GDG concluded that the overall certainty of evidence that pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs have an impact against malaria compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs was moderate.\nConditional recommendation against, Moderate certainty evidence\nPyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs vs pyrethroid-PBO ITNs (2023)\nPyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs are not recommended for deployment over pyrethroid-PBO ITNs for prevention of malaria in adults and children in areas with pyrethroid resistance.\nThe conditionality of the recommendation against the deployment of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs instead of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs is based on the GDG’s judgement that the balance of effects favours pyrethroid-PBO ITNs over pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs and that, based on current cost and efficacy data, pyrethroid-PBO ITNs are more cost-effective. The GDG acknowledged that evidence to support this recommendation is derived from only a single trial in Africa.\nWHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO)\n54 of 478\nAs with all malaria interventions, post-distribution monitoring of ITNs to estimate coverage in terms of access to and use of ITNs is recommended. WHO also recommends that programmes conduct studies of ITN survival each time a campaign uses a new product such as pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs, including assessment of ITN integrity. Such studies will provide information on the life span of the product under field conditions and thus enable estimation of the period over which the additional impact against malaria may be maintained. The systematic review reported that, two years after deployment, 39% of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs were torn (defined as having a total hole area ≥ 790 cm² and therefore assumed to be not fit for use), compared to 28% of pyrethroid-only LLINs and 43% of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs.\nEvidence to decision\nBenefits and harms Given that the systematic review was limited to three studies with malaria outcomes, a number of potential effect modifiers could not be examined. The GDG concluded that the extent of the impact of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs is likely to vary by setting and will depend on several factors, such as intensity of malaria transmission, behaviour of the main malaria vectors, the level and mechanism(s) of insecticide resistance, and the usage of ITNs within a community. The GDG also noted that, across the studies, different pyrethroids (either permethrin or alphacypermethrin) were used in the ITNs and the impact on malaria may vary by the pyrethroid used. However, the panel’s overall judgement was that the anticipated desirable effects of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs would be moderate. Compared to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, the GDG considered the benefits to be minor.\nThe trial from the United Republic of Tanzania [60] included in the systematic review reported 90 (44.1%) adverse events in the pyrethroid-only LLIN group, 80 (38.8%) in the pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITN group and 17 (8.5%) in the pyrethroid-PBO ITN group. The authors also narratively reported that skin irritation was the most commonly reported adverse event; however, no adverse event was assessed as serious. While five deaths were reported in the cohort, three of these were from drowning, one was due to severe malaria and one was due to pneumonia; all deaths were judged to be unrelated to the study interventions.\nThe review also reported data from the same trial [60] on ITN integrity. The numbers (proportion) of ITNs that were torn (defined as hole area ≥ 790 cm²) were reported as 86 (28%) in the pyrethroid-only LLIN group, 109 (39%) in the pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITN group and 81 (43%) in the pyrethroid-PBO ITN group.\nOverall, the GDG judged the magnitude of undesirable effects associated with pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs to be small compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs. However, compared to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, the undesirable effects were judged to be large. Overall, the GDG concluded that, compared to pyrethroid-",

However, compared to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, the undesirable effects were judged to be large. Overall, the GDG concluded that, compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs, the balance of effects probably favours pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs, but when comparing pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, the balance of effects was judged to favour the comparator, namely pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. Moderate Certainty of the evidence. Based on the systematic review, the GDG concluded that the overall certainty of evidence that pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs have an impact against malaria was moderate, compared to both pyrethroid-only LLINs and pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. Values and preferences. No research was identified regarding preferences and values. The GDG judged that there was probably no important uncertainty or variability associated with pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs. Resources. Apart from the higher commodity cost of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs, similar resources would be needed for their deployment as those listed for pyrethroid-only LLINs. (See table provided under “Resources and other considerations” for pyrethroid-only LLINs.) Based on cost data reported by the study in the United Republic of Tanzania [58], pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs were estimated to cost US$ 3.68 per ITN, while pyrethroid-only LLINs and pyrethroid-PBO ITNs were estimated to cost US$ 2.07 and US$ 2.98 per ITN, respectively. Based on these costs, estimated at the time of the trial (2018), the GDG judged that there may be moderate additional costs associated with deploying pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs instead of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. Based on the likely scale of ITN deployment, the moderate additional cost per ITN reported from the trial in Uganda [58] could amount to considerable additional costs associated with a switch to pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs, which would need to be met to maintain the same population coverage. The GDG, however, remarked that unit costs change over time and often decrease as new technologies are brought to scale. As pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs are scaled up, further review will be needed to determine whether this cost difference remains. National programmes are encouraged to pay specific attention to the commodity cost, as this will also vary depending on required quantities and lead-times and will be a key ingredient to the separately developed guidance on ITN prioritization. Justification. Pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs combine a pyrethroid insecticide and an insect growth regulator (IGR). The two ingredients have different entomological effects. The pyrethroid insecticide rapidly kills mosquitoes by targeting voltage-gated sodium channels associated with the nervous system of the insect. The IGR is a hormone mimic that does not directly kill insects but disrupts their growth and reproduction. Mosquitoes that are not killed by the pyrethroid may be sterilized and/or have their fecundity reduced, thereby preventing multiplication of the insecticide-resistant mosquitoes. Pyriproxyfen has also shown some impact on a mosquito’s life span. Pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs, therefore, fall into the third class of ITNs recognized by WHO, which consists of ITNs primarily designed to sterilize and/or reduce the fecundity of insecticide-resistant mosquitoes. It is unlikely that mosquitoes exposed to ITNs that combine a pyrethroid and an IGR will be resistant to both active ingredients due to their different modes of action and limited to no selection pressure exerted so far for pyriproxyfen resistance. As such, pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs could have a greater impact against malaria than pyrethroid-only LLINs in areas with pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors. To justify the deployment of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen nets, the insecticide resistance status of the principal vector(s) in the area where deployment is planned should be assessed. However, regular insecticide resistance testing by means of bioassays [22] should already be part of routine monitoring operations and programme budgets. The systematic review reported that the study conducted in the United Republic of Tanzania [60] carried out cost-effectiveness analyses comparing pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs and pyrethroid-PBO ITNs with pyrethroid-only LLINs over the two-year period of the trial. Pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs were estimated to incur 9 DALYs [SD 71] per 10 000 total population, while pyrethroid-PBO ITNs averted 37 DALYs [SD 72] per 10 000 population. When considering the costs of malaria diagnosis and treatment, pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs were reported to be the more costly (incremental cost US$ 9621 [SD 1327] per 10 000 population), whereas pyrethroid-PBO ITNs were less costly (US$ 4816 [SD 1360]) from all perspectives. The GDG concluded that the cost-effectiveness would probably favour pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs over pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs. The GDG was concerned that, given flatlined funding for malaria [3], the procurement of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs may negatively impact the ability of programmes to maintain ITN coverage of at-risk populations while not improving impact. Due to the current moderately higher cost of this commodity, there is a risk that programmes may not be able to maintain existing ITN coverage or coverage of other malaria interventions if no additional funds to cover the additional costs are made available. Some pragmatic prioritization guidance [61] has been provided with a view to supporting programmes in decision-making around the deployment of new types of nets in resource-constrained environments. Equity. The GDG judged that the impact on the equity of using pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs would vary. If switching from either of these types of nets to more costly pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs resulted in lower coverage of preventive interventions for those at risk of malaria, equity may be reduced. However, if the switch resulted in no reduction in coverage (due to increased funding or a price reduction) and those populations who were previously provided with potentially less effective pyrethroid-only LLINs were then protected from malaria by a potentially slightly more effective intervention, equity may increase. Acceptability. No research was identified regarding the acceptability of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs. However, the GDG judged that such ITNs would be acceptable to key stakeholders, given that they are largely similar to pyrethroid-only LLINs and pyrethroid-PBO ITNs in terms of their appearance, design and use. Feasibility. Although no research was identified regarding the feasibility of implementing pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs, the GDG judged that deploying such ITNs would be as feasible as deploying pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. The systematic review [Barker et al unpublished evidence] identified and included three trials [60][62][63] from western and eastern Africa, evaluating the impact of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs on incidence of clinical malaria and prevalence of malaria.",

The systematic review [Barker et al unpublished evidence] identified and included three trials [60][62][63] from western and eastern Africa, evaluating the impact of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs on incidence of clinical malaria and prevalence of malaria infection, compared to either pyrethroid-only LLINs or pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. All trials were conducted in areas of high malaria transmission (malaria infection prevalence in children under 10 years of age recorded by the trials as 20–40% and as 50–70% in children under 5) and pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes. Compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs, incidence of clinical malaria (defined as malaria symptoms, i.e. current fever of temperature ≥ 37.5°C or fever in the past 48 hours, plus malaria parasitaemia) decreased by approximately 20% one year after deployment of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs and by 15% two years post-deployment. Prevalence of malaria infection (regardless of symptoms) was reduced by approximately 30% one year post-deployment and by approximately 20% two years post-deployment. Compared with pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, the use of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs was associated with a two-fold higher incidence of clinical malaria one year after ITN deployment, with a slightly increased or no effect on incidence two years post-deployment. There was no effect on prevalence of malaria infection one or two years post-deployment. The trials in Benin and in the United Republic of Tanzania will investigate the impact against malaria over 36-month, which aligns with the replenishment cycle of ITNs in most field settings. Results of these trials are expected to be appraised in the near future.\nThe GDG concluded on a conditional recommendation to deploy pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs in areas where malaria vectors are resistant to pyrethroids. The recommendation for deployment was based on the moderate effect against malaria and the GDG’s judgement that the benefits probably outweighed any harms of deploying pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs instead of pyrethroid-only LLINs. The conditionality, however, was stipulated based on the panel conclusion that pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs were less cost-effective than pyrethroid-only LLINs and, due to the higher unit cost of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs, extra resources would be required to replace pyrethroid-only LLINs with these dual active ingredient ITNs. Unless additional resources are provided, a switch to pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs would result in reduced coverage of populations at risk of malaria, thereby negatively affecting coverage and equity.\nThe panel conditionally recommended against the deployment of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs instead of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs in areas of insecticide resistance. This decision was based on the lack of evidence of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs having a greater impact against malaria compared to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs; the balance of effects favours pyrethroid-PBO ITNs over pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs. Based on these results and the current unit costs of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs, pyrethroid-PBO ITNs are currently more cost-effective. Extra resources would be required while there would be no benefit of deploying pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs instead of pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, and, in the absence of additional resources, this would result in reduced coverage of malaria interventions for populations at risk of malaria, thereby negatively affecting equity. The GDG also acknowledged that the available evidence on the efficacy of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs compared to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs was from only one trial conducted in the United Republic of Tanzania, where malaria transmission is high and An. funestus is the primary malaria vector, which in turn limits generalizability of the findings to other geographies with different anopheline vectors and eco-epidemiological characteristics.\nResearch needs\nWHO encourages additional high-quality research to generate further evidence on:\n• the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs in areas with insecticide resistance traits in the local primary vectors that differ from those of the available studies;\n• contextual factors (e.g. acceptability, feasibility, resource use, cost-effectiveness, equity, values and preferences) related to use of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs;\n• the durability of pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen ITNs over the replenishment cycle of ITNs in field settings (generally three years or more).\nPractical info\nIn deciding whether to deploy ITNs in emergency settings, consideration must be given to whether ITNs are appropriate for that setting, taking into account vector characteristics, human behaviour and available infrastructure. ITNs are most effective where the principal malaria vector(s) bite predominantly at night after people have retired under their nets and where the mosquitoes are susceptible to the insecticides used to treat the nets. Data will need to be collected to assess whether these criteria are met. There may be more limited capacity to gather such data in humanitarian emergencies than in more stable settings. In addition to assessing whether ITNs are appropriate, consideration of the feasibility of deploying nets in a particular emergency setting is important. Depending on the infrastructure, access, logistical capacity and resources available, procuring and distributing nets may be more challenging than in more stable settings. Instability in such settings may challenge long-term planning and so result in shorter lead times and consequently higher costs. It is also important to determine whether the shelters or housing structures in such settings are suitable for hanging a net. In some situations, the structure may have nowhere to hang a net or it may be too small to adequately accommodate a net.\nOther considerations for the deployment, monitoring and evaluation of nets apply equally to emergency and non-emergency settings. Please consult the practical information under the WHO recommendations for the different ITN classes. However, as for collecting data to assess whether nets are suitable in an area, the feasibility and capacity to regularly collect information for M&E in emergency settings must be assessed.\nEvidence to decision\nStrong recommendation for, High certainty evidence\nInsecticide-treated nets: Humanitarian emergency setting (2022)\nInsecticide-treated nets (ITNs) should be deployed for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission affected by a humanitarian emergency.

As with ITNs deployed in more stable settings, WHO recommends that ITNs that are prequalified by WHO be selected for use in humanitarian emergencies.\nWhen considering deployment of ITNs in humanitarian emergencies, the infrastructure, access, logistical capacity and resources available must be taken into account, as these may influence the feasibility and cost of procuring and deploying nets.",

When considering deployment of ITNs in humanitarian emergencies, the infrastructure, access, logistical capacity and resources available must be taken into account, as these may influence the feasibility and cost of procuring and deploying nets. Benefits and harms The systematic review (Messenger et al unpublished evidence) assessed the epidemiological impact of pyrethroid-only LLINs against malaria compared to no nets in areas affected by humanitarian emergencies in the chronic phase – in Myanmar, on the Myanmar–Thailand border and in Pakistan [49][50][51][54]; no studies were found from areas in the acute phase of an emergency. The review presented evidence that pyrethroid-only LLINs were associated with reduced P. falciparum parasite incidence (rate ratio: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.37–0.79; four studies; high-certainty evidence) and P. falciparum parasite prevalence (rate ratio: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.40–0.88); two studies; high-certainty evidence) compared to no nets. Deployment of pyrethroid-only LLINs was reported to probably result in reduced P. vivax parasite incidence (rate ratio: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.51–0.94; three studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Little or no difference was seen in P. vivax parasite prevalence (risk ratio: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.75–1.34; two studies; low-certainty evidence). The systematic review did not report any unintended consequences of the intervention. However, the GDG noted that the potential undesirable effects identified for the use of ITNs in stable settings are also likely to apply in humanitarian emergencies. The GDG also noted that if nets are deployed in settings where the population is accommodated in tents or small houses (structures that are commonly shelters in emergency settings), uptake and use may be limited because the restricted space may not allow the net to be hung easily and the net may encroach on the space required for other household activities. The GDG judged these potential undesirable effects to be minimal. Although the studies included in the systematic review were limited to the use of pyrethroid-only LLINs, the likely benefits extend to other types of ITNs that are recommended by WHO for large-scale deployment in more stable settings (e.g. pyrethroid-PBO nets). The GDG judged the balance of benefits and harms to favour the use of ITNs that have been recommended for use in more stable settings to prevent and control malaria in humanitarian emergency settings. High Certainty of the evidence The systematic review assessed that the overall certainty of the evidence that pyrethroid‐only LLINs have an impact on malaria in humanitarian emergency settings was high. Values and preferences No research was identified regarding preferences and values. The GDG judged that there was probably no important uncertainty or variability. Resources Based on cost data published in 2021 [36], the median economic cost of ITNs was US$ 1.39 per person protected per year, drawing on data from non-emergency settings. The GDG noted that the cost of deploying nets in humanitarian emergency settings may be higher than in stable settings for a number of reasons. First, the cost of transporting nets may increase, particularly for locations that are difficult to access. Second, in some emergency settings, there may be a need to establish human capacity for net delivery, which could incur further cost. Finally, given the nature of emergency settings, the necessity for immediate deployment of interventions may require shorter lead times for procurement, resulting in higher costs of the commodity. The GDG judged that deploying ITNs would therefore involve moderate costs and cost more than deploying ITNs in stable settings. A review of the cost and cost-effectiveness of malaria control interventions [36] in more stable settings reported that the cost-effectiveness of ITNs compared to no ITNs was US$ 5.85 per episode averted, US$ 1281.97 per death averted, and US$ 44.51 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. The GDG noted that the cost-effectiveness of deploying pyrethroid-only LLINs may depend largely on the setting: the cost-effectiveness may vary with the infrastructure in the setting and available capacity, as well as the malaria transmission level in the area of deployment. The GDG judged that, while there may be some upfront costs to deliver nets in such settings, given the associated benefits to protecting such vulnerable populations, deploying pyrethroid-only LLINs would be cost-effective compared to no nets. Equity Providing ITNs to populations in areas with ongoing malaria transmission affected by humanitarian emergencies was judged by the GDG to result in increased equity, as populations in these settings are at increased risk of malaria infection. Acceptability No research was identified regarding the acceptability of pyrethroid-only LLINs in emergency settings. Nevertheless, the GDG judged that ITNs would be acceptable to key stakeholders, given that they are generally well accepted in more stable settings. The acceptability may improve further over time as users see the benefit to protecting themselves from malaria. Feasibility No research was identified regarding the feasibility of implementing pyrethroid-only LLINs in humanitarian emergency settings. The GDG judged that distributing ITNs would be feasible, but consideration would need to be given to whether: • the sleeping structures in the setting are amenable to having nets installed; • nets can be procured in time and within the given budget; • there is sufficient human capacity to deliver nets in the emergency setting; and • there are sufficient resources available to cover potential extra costs to access the population, particularly hard-to-reach populations and those affected by conflict. Justification The systematic review [55] (Messenger et al unpublished evidence) compared pyrethroid‐only LLINs to no nets in terms of malaria outcomes in areas affected by humanitarian emergencies. The review concluded that deploying pyrethroid‐only LLINs was associated with reductions in P. falciparum parasite incidence, P. falciparum parasite prevalence and P. vivax parasite incidence compared to no nets. It was unclear whether pyrethroid‐only LLINs reduced P. vivax parasite prevalence in these settings. The included studies were all from emergencies in the chronic phase in Asia – in the Republic of Union of Myanmar, on the Myanmar–Thailand border, and in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Deploying nets in the acute stage of an emergency may differ from deploying nets once some infrastructure has been established, due to numerous logistical challenges. Humanitarian emergencies in other parts of the world may differ in terms of the available capacity, infrastructure, community behaviour and acceptance.

Given that the systematic review only identified and included four trials, a number of potential effect modifiers could not be examined. However, as for pyrethroid-only LLINs deployed in more stable settings, the impact of nets may vary depending on, for example, the behaviour of the mosquito species, the level and mechanism(s) of insecticide resistance, parasite prevalence, and net usage by the population. While the review included studies that only examined the impact of pyrethroid-only LLINs, other ITNs recommended by WHO in more stable settings are likely to have a similar balance of benefits and harms to those deployed in humanitarian emergencies. Important considerations regarding resource needs, acceptability and feasibility when deploying pyrethroid-only LLINs in emergency settings should largely apply to other WHO-recommended ITNs. Based on the review findings and these considerations, the GDG judged that the desirable effects of deploying WHO-recommended ITNs, not just pyrethroid-only LLINs, in humanitarian emergencies compared to no nets would outweigh the undesirable effects. Based on the high certainty of the findings from emergency settings and the feasibility, acceptability and cost-effectiveness of ITNs in more stable settings, the panel felt that the recommendation should be classified as strong. Research needs: WHO encourages funding of high-quality research to generate further evidence on: the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences of ITNs in the acute phase of humanitarian emergencies (where logistics and priorities may differ); and contextual factors (i.e. acceptability, feasibility, resource use, cost-effectiveness, equity, values and preferences) related to products from the different ITN classes covered by a WHO recommendation deployed in humanitarian emergencies. Practical info: To achieve and maintain optimal ITN coverage, countries should apply a combination of mass free net distribution through campaigns and continuous distribution through multiple channels, in particular through ANC clinics and the EPI. Mass campaigns are the only proven cost-effective way to rapidly achieve high and equitable coverage. Complementary continuous distribution channels are also required because coverage gaps can start to appear almost immediately post-campaign due to net deterioration, loss of nets, and population growth. Mass campaigns should distribute one ITN for every two persons at risk of malaria. However, for procurement purposes, the calculation to determine the number of ITNs required needs to be adjusted at the population level, since many households have an odd number of members. Therefore, a ratio of one ITN for every 1.8 persons in the target population should be used to estimate ITN requirements, unless data to inform a different quantification ratio are available. In places where the most recent population census is more than five years old, countries can consider including a buffer (e.g. adding 10% after the 1.8 ratio has been applied) or using data from previous ITN campaigns to justify an alternative buffer amount. Campaigns should also normally be planned to be repeated every three years, unless available empirical evidence justifies the use of a longer or shorter interval between campaigns. In addition to these data-driven decisions, a shorter distribution interval may be justified during humanitarian emergencies, as the resulting increase in population movement may leave populations uncovered by vector control, potentially increasing their risk of infection and the risk of epidemics. Continuous distribution through ANC and EPI channels should remain functional before, during and after mass distribution campaigns. In determining the optimal mix of ITN delivery mechanisms to ensure optimal coverage and maximized efficiency, consideration should be given to the required number of nets, the cost per net distributed and coverage over time. For example, during mass distribution campaign years, other delivery schemes may need to be altered to avoid oversupply of ITNs. 'Top-up' campaigns (i.e. ITN distributions that take into account existing nets in households and provide each household only with the additional number of nets needed to bring it up to the target number) are not recommended. Substantial field experience has shown that accurate quantification for such campaigns is generally not feasible and the cost of accounting for existing nets outweighs the benefits. There should be a single national ITN plan and policy that includes both continuous and campaign distribution strategies. This should be developed and implemented under the leadership of the NMP, based on an analysis of local opportunities and constraints, and identification of a combination of distribution channels with which to achieve optimal coverage and minimize gaps. This unified plan should include a comprehensive net quantification and gap analysis for all public sector ITN distribution channels. As much as possible, the plan should include major ITN contributions by the private sector. Therefore, in addition to mass campaigns, the distribution strategy could include: ANC, EPI and other child health clinics: These should be considered high-priority continuous ITN distribution channels in countries where these services are used by a large proportion of the population at risk of malaria, as occurs in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Schools, faith- and community-based networks, and agricultural and food-security support schemes: These can also be explored as channels for ITN distribution in countries where such approaches are feasible and equitable. Investigating the potential use of these distribution channels in complex emergencies is particularly important. Occupation-related distribution channels: In some settings, particularly in Asia, the risk of malaria may be strongly associated with specific occupations (e.g. plantation and farm workers and their families, miners, soldiers and forest workers). In these settings, opportunities for distribution through channels such as private sector employers, workplace programmes and farmers’ organizations may be explored. Private or commercial sector channels: These can be important channels for supplementing free ITN distribution through public sector channels. Access to ITNs can also be expanded by facilitating the exchange of vouchers or coupons provided. Recipients of ITNs should be advised (through appropriate communication strategies) to continue using their nets, irrespective of the condition and age of the net, until a replacement net is available.",

Access to ITNs can also be expanded by facilitating the exchange of vouchers or coupons provided through public sector channels for a free or subsidized ITN at participating retail outlets. ITN products distributed through the private sector should be regulated by the national registrar of pesticides in order to ensure that product quality is in line with WHO recommendations.\nThe procurement of ITNs with attributes that are more costly (e.g., nets of conical shape) is not recommended for countries in sub-Saharan Africa, unless nationally representative data clearly show that the use of ITNs with particular attributes increases significantly among populations at risk of malaria. To build an evidence base to support the purchase of more costly nets, investigation into the population's preferences and whether adhering to those preferences translates into increased use of ITNs may also be warranted, particularly in situations where standard nets are unlikely to suit the lifestyle of specific population groups at risk of malaria, such as may be the case for nomadic populations.\nThe life spans of ITNs can vary widely among individual nets used within a single household or community, as well as among nets used in different settings. This makes it difficult to plan the rate or frequency at which replacement nets need to be procured and delivered. All malaria programmes that have undertaken medium- to large-scale ITN distributions should conduct ITN durability monitoring in line with available guidance to inform appropriate replacement intervals. Where there is evidence that ITNs are not being adequately cared for or used, programmes should design and implement BCC activities aimed at improving these behaviours.\nIn countries where untreated nets are widely available, NMPs should promote access to ITNs. Strategies for treating untreated nets can also be considered, for example, by supporting access to insecticide treatment kits.\nAs NMPs implement different mixes of distribution methods in different geographic areas, there will be a need to accurately track ITN coverage at subnational levels. Subnational responses should be triggered if coverage falls below programmatic targets. Tracking should differentiate among the contributions of various delivery channels to overall ITN coverage.\nCountries should generate data on defined standard indicators of coverage and access rates in order to ascertain whether optimal coverage has been achieved and maintained. The data should also inform changes in implementation in order to improve performance and progress towards the achievement of programmatic targets. Currently, the three basic survey indicators are: i) the proportion of households with at least one ITN; ii) the proportion of the population with access to an ITN within their household; and iii) the proportion of the population reporting having slept under an ITN the previous night (by age [<5 years; 5–14 years; 15+ years], gender and access to ITN).\nJustification In December 2017, WHO published updated recommendations on Achieving and maintaining universal coverage with LLINs for malaria control [64]. These recommendations were developed and revised based on expert opinion through broad consultation, including multiple rounds of reviews by the Malaria Policy Advisory Group (MPAG). Under the section on “practical information”, these recommendations have been summarized and slightly revised to clarify that these recommendations are not specific to LLINs, but apply to ITNs in general.\nPractical info It is important to determine whether the environmental benefits outweigh the costs when identifying the best disposal option for old ITNs and their packaging. For malaria programmes in most endemic countries, there are limited options for dealing with ITN collection. Recycling is not currently a practical option in most malaria-endemic countries (with some exceptions for countries with a well-developed plastics industry). High-temperature incineration is likely to be logistically difficult and expensive in most settings. In practice, when malaria programmes have retained or collected packaging material in the process of distributing ITNs, it has mostly been burned in the open air. This method of disposal may lead to the release of dioxins, which are harmful to human health.\nIf such plastic material (with packaging an issue at the point of distribution and old ITNs an intermittent issue at household level when the net is no longer in use) is left in the community, it is likely to be re-used in a variety of ways. While the insecticide exposure entailed by this kind of re-use has yet to be fully studied, the expected negative health and environmental impacts of leaving the waste in the community are considered to be less than amassing it in one location and/or burning it in the open air. Since the material from nets represents only a small proportion of total plastic consumption, it will often be more efficient for old ITNs to be dealt with as part of larger and more general solid-waste programmes. National environment management authorities have an obligation to consider and plan for what happens to old ITNs and packaging materials in the environment in collaboration with other relevant partners.\nJustification Currently, ITNs and the vast majority of their packaging (bags and baling materials) are made of non-biodegradable plastics [65]. The large-scale deployment of ITNs has given rise to questions as to the most appropriate and cost-effective way to deal with the resulting plastic waste, particularly given that most endemic countries do not currently have the resources to manage ITN collection and waste disposal programmes.\nA pilot study was conducted to examine patterns of ITN usage and disposal in three African countries (Kenya, Madagascar and United Republic of Tanzania). Findings of this pilot study, along with other background information were used to generate recommendations through the WHO Vector Control Technical Expert Group (VCTEG) and MPAG on best practices with respect to managing waste.\nPractice Statement Management of old ITNs (2019) Old ITNs should only be collected where there is assurance that: i) communities are not left without nets, i.e. new ITNs are distributed to replace old ones; and ii) there is a suitable and sustainable plan in place for safe disposal of the collected material. If ITNs and their packaging (bags and baling materials) are collected, the best option for disposal is high-temperature incineration. They should not be burned in the open air. In the absence of appropriate facilities, they should be buried away from water sources and preferably in non-permeable soil. Recipients of ITNs should be advised (through appropriate communication strategies) not to dispose of their nets in any water body, as the residual insecticide on the net can be toxic to aquatic organisms (especially fish).",

Recipients of ITNs should be advised (through appropriate communication strategies) not to dispose of their nets in any water body, as the residual insecticide on the net can be toxic to aquatic organisms (especially fish).\nThe following are the main findings from the pilot study and other background material:\n• ITNs entering domestic use in Africa each year contribute approximately 100,000 tonnes of plastic and represent a per capita rate of plastic consumption of 200g per year. This is substantial in absolute terms; however, it constitutes only approximately 1% to 5% of the total plastic consumption in Africa and thus is small compared to other sources of plastic and other forms of plastic consumption.\n• The plastic from ITNs is treated with a small amount of pyrethroid insecticide (less than 1% per unit mass for most products), and plastic packaging is therefore considered a pesticide product/container.\n• Old ITNs and other nets may be used for a variety of alternative purposes, usually due to the perceived ineffectiveness of the net, loss of net physical integrity or presence of another net.\n• ITNs that no longer serve a purpose are generally disposed of at the community level along with other household waste by discarding them in the environment, burning them in the open, or placing them into pits.\n• ITN collection was not implemented on a large scale or sustained in any of the pilot study countries. It may be feasible to recycle ITNs, but it is not practical or cost-effective at this point, as there would need to be specialized adaptation and upgrading of recycling facilities before insecticide-contaminated materials could be included in this process.\n• Two important and potentially hazardous practices are: i) routinely removing ITNs from bags at the point of distribution and burning discarded bags and old ITNs, which can produce highly toxic fumes including dioxins, and ii) discarding old ITNs and their packaging in water, as they may contain high concentrations of residual insecticides that are toxic to aquatic organisms, particularly fish.\n• Insecticide-treated plastics can be incinerated safely in high-temperature furnaces, but suitable facilities are lacking in most countries. Burial away from water sources and preferably in non-permeable soil is an appropriate method to dispose of net bags and old ITNs in the absence of a suitable high-temperature incinerator.\n• In most countries, ministries of environment (national environment management authorities) are responsible for setting up and enforcing laws/regulations to manage plastic waste broadly. Although some countries have established procedures for dealing with pesticide-contaminated plastics, it is unrealistic to expect NMPs to single-handedly address the problem of managing waste from ITNs. Environmental regulations; leadership and guidance from national environmental authorities; and oversight from international agencies, such as the United Nations Environment Programme, are all necessary.\nPractical info\nSurfaces (indoors and outdoors) could potentially be treated with residual insecticides or other residual active ingredients against mosquitoes in ways other than spraying, for example by painting. The systematic review aimed to gather evidence on alternative methods of applying insecticides and outdoor treatments. However, no studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. Furthermore, surfaces may be fully or partially treated (such as treating the lower or upper sections of walls or specific rooms). The latter approach may be more cost-effective. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether partial surface treatments are as effective or as cost-effective as full surface treatments. The practical guidance provided here, therefore, refers to the implementation of IRS treating all indoor surfaces of a structure.\nStrong recommendation for, Very low certainty evidence\nIndoor residual spraying (2025)\nIRS should be deployed for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults living in areas with ongoing malaria transmission.\nWHO recommends that products from the insecticide classes indicated below be used for IRS. Selection of the product should be made from the WHO list of prequalified products, and with due consideration of the insecticide susceptibility of the local malaria vector(s).\nIRS is considered to be an appropriate intervention where:\n• the majority of the vector population tends to feed and rest indoors;\n• people mainly sleep indoors at night;\n• the malaria transmission pattern is such that the population can be protected by one or two rounds of IRS per year; and\n• the majority of structures are suitable for spraying.\nThe malaria transmission pattern is such that the population can be protected by one or two rounds of IRS per year; the majority of structures are suitable for spraying. IRS may not be suitable for some structures, such as open-sided structures, but, in general, insecticides can be applied to several different wall types (e.g. cement, painted surfaces, brick, wood, mud). However, it is important to consider whether the surface material compromises the residual nature of the insecticide (e.g. some plastic sheeting materials). The longevity of the insecticide also varies with the insecticide used and its formulation. Residual efficacy, i.e. the insecticide’s ability to still kill mosquitoes that are exposed to sprayed surfaces, needs to continue for at least the duration of the malaria transmission season following the application of the insecticide to the substrate. If treatment of certain surfaces or use of a particular insecticide and/or formulation reduces its residual life, additional spray rounds may be needed to provide population protection throughout the transmission season(s). More information is provided in the WHO publication Operational manual on indoor residual spraying: control of vectors of malaria, Aedes-borne diseases, Chagas disease, leishmaniases and lymphatic filariasis [66].\nInsecticide formulations for IRS currently recommended by WHO fall into several major insecticide classes with different modes of action on the vector species. The insecticide classes with products that have been prequalified, are listed below:\nAcetylcholinesterase inhibitors\n• Organophosphates: pirimiphos-methyl\n• Carbamates: bendiocarb\nNicotinic acetylcholine receptor competitive modulators\n• Neonicotinoids: clothianidin\nGABA-gated chloride channel allosteric modulators\n• Meta-diamides: broflanilide\n• Isoxazolines: isocycloseram\nUncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation via disruption of the proton gradient\n• Pyrroles: chlorfenapyr\nSodium channel modulators\n• Pyrethroids: alphacypermethrin, deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, etofenprox, bifenthrin\n• Organochlorines (e.g. DDT): no prequalified products available\nWhile the organochlorine DDT has a long history of use for IRS, there are no organochlorine IRS formulations prequalified.",

This means that no DDT product has been assessed by WHO for its efficacy, safety and quality for vector control, and no inspection of manufacturing sites has been conducted. Unlike the other insecticide classes covered by WHO’s recommendation for IRS, DDT has been classified as a persistent organic pollutant. As such, its production and use are strictly restricted by an international agreement known as the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants [79]. The Convention’s objective is to protect both human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants. When the Stockholm Convention was established in 2004, it provided an exemption for the production and use of DDT for disease vector control, mainly because of the absence of equally effective and efficient alternatives at the time. However, the expansion of products available for IRS and overall innovation in vector control interventions have provided multiple viable options as alternatives to using DDT in IRS.\nWHO actively supports the promotion of chemical safety and, together with the United Nations Environment Programme, shares a common commitment to the global goal of reducing and eventually eliminating the use of DDT, while minimizing the burden of vector-borne diseases. DDT use for malaria vector control has declined over the years and WHO supports the use of alternative insecticides or other vector control methods.\nWith the availability of multiple classes of insecticides for IRS, there are very few cases in which the use of DDT may still be warranted. Any decision to use DDT for malaria vector control needs to be based on a detailed analysis that considers all other potential options for vector control and provides clear reasoning for choosing DDT over the other options. WHO considers DDT to be a last resort, not a first choice. If DDT is selected, it should be used under strict control measures and only for the intended purpose. Its use requires that the conditions set by the Stockholm Convention be met. Effective use and safe storage of DDT rely on compliance with well-established and well-enforced rules and regulations in accordance with national guidelines and following WHO technical guidance provided in the WHO operational manual for IRS for malaria transmission, control and elimination [66]. Where DDT is deployed, it is essential for adequate resources and technical support to be in place to ensure the sound management of this persistent organic pollutant.\nWhen selecting insecticides for IRS, it is important to investigate the resistance profile of the local vectors to select insecticides that are effective against the local dominant vectors. Continuous use of the same product in the same area for multiple seasons is not recommended, as this may select for resistance in mosquitoes. Switching to other insecticides to which mosquitoes are susceptible should therefore be planned proactively. Furthermore, in deciding which products and formulations to procure, residual efficacy must be considered. Insecticides should remain efficacious throughout the transmission season after application and must do so when applied to a variety of surfaces (cement, mud or wood) [80]. Insecticides are available in various formulations to increase their longevity on different surfaces.\nCommunity acceptance of IRS is critical to the programme’s success, particularly because it requires householders to grant permission for spray teams to enter their house. It also involves disruption to the household, requiring householders to remove personal items from their house prior to spraying. Furthermore, some insecticide formulations leave unsightly residue on sprayed surfaces and may cause decolourization of painted surfaces. Repeated, frequent spraying of houses over extended periods can lead to refusal by householders. Reduced acceptance has been an impediment to effective IRS implementation in various parts of the world [81]. It is therefore important to develop information, education and communication (IEC) strategies to keep the community informed and engage with communities to ensure full support and cooperation.\nIRS is generally conducted campaign-style across a large geographical area or higher risk area prior to the beginning of a malaria transmission season (i.e. proactive spraying). However, IRS can be deployed in a much smaller, more targeted way in the likely location of infection of an index case and its neighbours. This is termed reactive IRS; further information and guidance is provided under the “Interventions in the final phase of elimination and prevention of re-establishment” section of these Guidelines. When IRS is deployed proactively in wider areas of ongoing malaria transmission, it is important to maintain optimal coverage (see Section 4.1.1 interventions recommended for large scale deployment and the glossary for further details on how optimal coverage is determined).\nFollowing application of the insecticide(s), it is important to determine the quality of the application and to subsequently monitor the residual activity by using wall cone bioassays. It is also important to evaluate the impact of IRS through entomological surveillance activities and assess any impact on the environment.\nFurther detailed information is provided in the WHO publication Operational manual on indoor residual spraying: control of vectors of malaria, Aedes-borne diseases, Chagas disease, leishmaniases and lymphatic filariasis [66]. This manual is designed to assist malaria programme managers, entomologists and public health officers in designing, implementing, and monitoring and evaluating high-quality IRS programmes.\nEvidence to decision\nBenefits and harms An updated systematic review (Stone et al unpublished evidence) investigated the impact of residual surface treatment (RST) of insecticides on malaria compared to no vector control intervention. RST could be applied indoors or outdoors to parts of the wall/ceiling or to its entirety, and involve different delivery methods. The current best practice in this area is IRS (see section 4.1.1). Only studies on the impact of IRS against malaria could be identified; no studies were identified on outdoor applications or applying treatments in other ways. Ten studies of IRS from Africa and Asia were included in the review: five cluster-randomized controlled trials (cRCTs), one quasi-experimental study and four controlled before-and-after studies.\nThe systematic review of these studies reported little or no effect of IRS on malaria incidence compared to no spraying (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.63–1.29; very low-certainty evidence) and provided very low-certainty evidence that all-age malaria parasite prevalence was lower in IRS study areas than in those without IRS. As the post-IRS period during which the impact was measured varied across studies, a summary estimate of the relative risk (RR) could not be calculated. Nevertheless,",

As the post-IRS period during which the impact was measured varied across studies, a summary estimate of the relative risk (RR) could not be calculated. Nevertheless, individual studies reported an RR of malaria infection of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.65–0.75) one month after application and of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.66–0.70) one year after deployment, compared to no IRS. The systematic review excluded studies in which other vector control interventions were being used, including insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). A separate systematic review investigating the impact of co-deploying IRS and ITNs compared to deploying ITNs alone was reviewed by the panel under a separate recommendation (see section 4.1.2) and is therefore not addressed here. Furthermore, studies comparing IRS to ITNs were not eligible for inclusion. However, nets were present across both arms in a few of the included studies, but at a low coverage level that was not deemed to result in a community-level impact against mosquito populations. Nevertheless, to determine whether the presence of nets at these levels did have a potential modifying effect against malaria incidence and prevalence, a subgroup analysis was carried out. The review reported that low coverage of nets had no significant modifying effect, although the number of studies included for each analysis was small. Subgroup analyses were also undertaken to investigate whether insecticide class and transmission intensity could have modifying effects against malaria incidence and prevalence. Neither insecticide class nor transmission intensity resulted in significant effects, but the number of studies included for each analysis was small. No subgroup analysis could be undertaken on IRS coverage level or on the effect of insecticide resistance, as most studies did not report these data. The GDG concluded that the extent of the impact of IRS is likely to vary by setting and will depend on a number of other factors, such as the intensity of malaria transmission, the behaviour of the main malaria vectors, the level and mechanism(s) of insecticide resistance, coverage of IRS and other vector control interventions, and operational factors associated with the implementation of IRS. Despite the little evidence drawn from these particular study designs, the impact of IRS on malaria has been demonstrated historically in multiple campaigns, such as during the Global Malaria Eradication Campaign in the 1950s [81], and various national programmatic deployments of IRS (e.g. [67][68][69][70][71]). Based on three studies included in the systematic review that reported unintended outcomes, most adverse events were considered mild. The frequency at which these adverse events occurred however, was not reported. In Pakistan, transitory skin irritation and headaches were reported in spray personnel and participants shortly after spraying. However, this effect attenuated after a few hours. Similar adverse events were reported in spray personnel in another study in the United Republic of Tanzania, where, despite wearing goggles and face masks, spray personnel suffered from paresthesia in their facial skin. Overall, the GDG judged the extent of undesirable effects associated with IRS to be small compared to no IRS. Very low Certainty of the evidence. The GDG concluded that the overall certainty of evidence was very low, based on the studies that met the inclusion criteria of the systematic review (Stone et al unpublished evidence). Despite anecdotal evidence demonstrating programmatic efficacy, for example in the 1950s as part of global malaria elimination efforts led by WHO, and the efforts of several national programmes in subsequent years, the systematic review evaluated the evidence derived from the included scientific studies, with pre-specified assessments for bias, indirectness, imprecision and inconsistency, as being of very low certainty evidence. WHO has thus moved forward with the most conservative level of evidence certainty and applied this to the global body of evidence. Values and preferences. No research was identified regarding preferences and values. The GDG judged that there was probably no important uncertainty or variability. Resources. The systematic review (Stone et al unpublished evidence) reported data on the cost and cost-effectiveness of IRS from four of the included studies dating back to 1995 [72][73][74][75][76]. However, the report did not provide a full systematic review of costs or a review of cost-effectiveness. The costs reported were highly variable depending on the setting, and the methods used to report costs were not consistent. A separate systematic review published in 2021 on the cost-effectiveness of malaria control interventions over the period 2005–2018, including vector control tools, reported that the median cost per person protected with IRS was US$ 5.70. Cost analysis reports are available from implementing partners that may provide more recent figures [77]. The list below, compiled by the GDG lists resources that should be considered for the deployment of IRS. Note that this table does not include resource needs for product selection or assessment of impact of the intervention.

    "content": "Spray pumps appropriate for the insecticide used; Collection tanks/wash buckets and cleaning supplies (varies with insecticide). Infrastructure requirements include: Appropriate national and regional/provincial storage; Temporary insecticide storage depots at the local level; Office space for management; Clean-up sites (soak pits/evaporation pools); Training facilities with spray practice capacity; Insectary to maintain mosquitoes exposed in QC wall cone bioassays; Communication with other ministries and sectors, e.g. environment, transport. Communication with the public, e.g. through the education sector, and advertising on local media to encourage uptake, and communication with the community/local leaders are also necessary. Governance/programme management requires: Spray team supervisors / district or higher level supervisors / clean-up site managers; BCC supervision; M&E support for QC; Entomology supervisors for QC testing.\n\nJustification: The systematic review aimed to evaluate the impact against malaria of Residual Spraying Treatment (RST) applied indoors or outdoors compared to no vector control, but only Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) studies met the inclusion criteria. The scope of the latest review was widened to include both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and study designs other than RCTs (i.e. non-randomized controlled trials and controlled before-and-after studies). However, even with inclusion of these other study designs, the review provided very low-certainty evidence that IRS had any impact on malaria incidence (IRR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.63–1.29) and that all-age malaria parasite prevalence was lower in IRS study areas than in those without IRS one month after application (RR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.65–0.75) and 12 months after application (RR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.66–0.70). Despite its long tradition and the large body of associated operational experience, few RCTs or other controlled studies have evaluated IRS compared to not deploying any vector control intervention. That being said, however, when carried out in wide-scale programmes, IRS has historically demonstrated itself to be an efficacious intervention for reducing adult mosquito vector density and longevity, and therefore, at least indirectly, has demonstrated its efficacy in reducing malaria transmission. The historical success of efficacious programmatic IRS has driven the ‘strong’ recommendation for deployment of the intervention, despite the lack of more recent high-quality scientific evidence derived from well-designed trials with appropriate controls. The systematic review did not include studies in which other vector control interventions, such as Insecticide-Treated Nets (ITNs), were used. A recent cRCT in Mozambique and the United Republic of Tanzania comparing IRS to ITNs found highly protective effects. The GDG maintained the strong WHO recommendation for IRS based on historical malaria eradication success.\n\nEquity: No research was identified regarding the impact of IRS on equity. The GDG commented that due to the community effect of IRS, even those who do not receive IRS could benefit. However, the panel noted that prioritizing larger, easily accessed populations might potentially reduce equity. The GDG stressed the need to target the populations most at risk for malaria when deploying IRS.\n\nAcceptability: The systematic review reported issues like wall decolourization, bad smell, and increased bed bug nuisance (DDT usage). However, other studies (using alpha-cypermethrin or general house spraying) reported satisfaction, leading the GDG to note that a larger review on acceptability was needed.\n\nFeasibility: The GDG judged that implementation is likely feasible given that IRS has been successfully deployed globally.\n\nResearch needs: WHO encourages additional high-quality research to generate further evidence on: the impact and potential harms/unintended consequences of IRS in urbanized areas with changing housing designs; alternative delivery methods (e.g., partial surfaces); outdoor RST; application methods (e.g., painting); and RST using slow-acting active ingredients; and the impact and potential harms/unintended consequences.",

    "content": "the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences of RST using different active ingredients that are slow-acting; and the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences of delivering RST in other ways, such as proactive versus reactive delivery in areas of low malaria transmission. Given ethical considerations associated with conducting trials that evaluate IRS against ‘no vector control intervention’, WHO encourages research comparing different vector control tools, such as IRS and ITNs, to generate evidence on their relative impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences. Practical info: In deciding whether to deploy IRS in emergency settings, as in more stable settings, consideration must be given to whether IRS is a suitable intervention for that setting, taking into account vector characteristics, human behaviour and available infrastructure. Indoor residual spraying: Humanitarian emergency setting (2022). IRS can be deployed for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission affected by a humanitarian emergency. The conditionality of this recommendation is largely driven by the very low certainty of the evidence that IRS reduces malaria in such settings and due to concerns around feasibility and cost. When deciding whether IRS may be appropriate for prevention and control of malaria in humanitarian emergency settings, programmes should consider: whether the structures are suitable for spraying. Some shelters provided in emergency settings may not be suitable for application of insecticides, such as open-sided structures and those built from materials that affect the residual nature of the insecticides; whether the target coverage of IRS can be feasibly achieved in the setting; whether there are sufficient resources to cover the relatively high costs associated with an IRS programme. In such settings, transport of commodities to hard-to-reach areas, coupled with the need to quickly procure items and establish human capacity to deliver the intervention, is likely to incur higher costs than when deploying IRS in more stable settings. As with the deployment of IRS in more stable settings, WHO recommends that products from insecticide classes indicated under the WHO recommendation, and that have been WHO-prequalified be selected for IRS use in humanitarian emergencies. It is important to ensure that the vector population is susceptible to the insecticide selected for spraying. IRS is considered an appropriate intervention where the majority of the vector population feeds and rests indoors; the vectors are susceptible to the insecticide that is being deployed; people mainly sleep indoors at night; the majority of structures are suitable for spraying; and where high enough coverage can be achieved to provide community-level protection. Data will need to be collected to assess whether these criteria are met. Data on vector composition, density, behaviour and insecticide susceptibility prior to deploying IRS not only provide information as to whether IRS is suitable in that setting, but also provide baseline information against which changes can be detected and monitored. Combined with data on coverage, this information can be used to gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of IRS. However, there may be more limited capacity to regularly gather such data in humanitarian emergencies than in more stable settings. Data are also required on the structures present in humanitarian emergencies to assess whether they are amenable to IRS. Open-sided structures or those with surfaces constructed from materials that impact the residual nature of the spray may not be suitable. Initiating any IRS programme requires a well-defined management system to be established with dedicated human, logistical, transport and financial resources. Programmes and implementing partners should consider whether the logistical needs (acquisition of commodities and equipment, recruitment of personnel and transport) can be met in emergency situations with the available resources within the given timeframe. Timeliness is a key factor in obtaining the maximum benefits from IRS; the spray should be applied over the shortest period of time just prior to the onset of the transmission season. As with ITNs, instability in humanitarian emergencies may reduce the options for long-term planning, resulting in shorter lead times for establishing a programme and acquiring supplies and equipment than in more stable settings. If commodities and personnel have to be sourced at short notice, procurement costs may be higher. Costs may also increase if more expensive means of transport are required for deployment in more remote, less accessible areas or those affected by conflict. As with more stable settings, ensuring optimal coverage to provide community-level protection is critical. To support this community acceptance of IRS is essential. Given that in some humanitarian emergencies, the local language may differ to that of the affected population, consideration should be given to whether messaging needs to be adapted. Evidence to decision: Benefits and harms. The systematic review [55] (Messenger et al unpublished evidence) assessed the epidemiological impact of IRS against malaria compared to no IRS in areas affected by humanitarian emergencies in the chronic phase; no studies were found from areas in the acute phase of an emergency. One RCT was carried out in Sudan [82] and two controlled before-after studies and one cross-sectional study were conducted in Pakistan [52][83][84]. While the case incidence of P. falciparum was lower with IRS, only one observational study contributed to this evidence (rate ratio: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.53–0.61; very low-certainty evidence). There was little to no difference in P. falciparum parasite prevalence between arms (rate ratio: 1.31; 95% CI: 0.91–1.88; one study; low-certainty evidence). P. vivax case incidence was lower compared to no IRS (rate ratio: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.49–0.52; very low-certainty evidence); however, only one observational study was included. Little or no difference was seen in P. vivax parasite prevalence between arms (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.25–2.14; two studies; very low-certainty evidence). The GDG judged that the extent of the desirable effects of IRS compared to no IRS is likely to vary depending on a number of factors. Many of these factors also apply to more stable settings: IRS works best when the majority of vectors rest indoors and are susceptible to the insecticides used; where people sleep indoors; where the population is not nomadic; and where the structures are sprayable and not too scattered. The suitability of structures for spraying is an important factor to consider in emergency settings. Tents are often used to provide emergency shelter and not all tent material will allow the application of the insecticide by spraying; in some areas, structures are open-sided. It may be that IRS is [the text chunk ends abruptly here].",

    "content": "The suitability of structures for spraying is an important factor to consider in emergency settings. Tents are often used to provide emergency shelter, and not all tent material will allow the application of the insecticide by spraying; in some areas, structures are open-sided. It may be that IRS is more appropriate in the chronic phase of an emergency than in the acute phase due to the type of shelter, infrastructure, and human capacity likely to have been established by this later stage. The systematic review did not report any unintended consequences of the intervention. However, the GDG noted that undesirable effects may be similar to those that may arise when deploying IRS in non-emergency settings (see “Evidence to decision” section of the recommendation for IRS). These undesirable effects were judged by the GDG to be minimal. The GDG judged the balance of benefits and harms to probably favour the use of IRS against malaria compared to no IRS in humanitarian emergency settings. Very low certainty of the evidence. WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) 70 of 478. The systematic review assessed the overall certainty of evidence that IRS has an impact on malaria in humanitarian emergency settings to be very low. Values and preferences: No research was identified regarding preferences and values. The GDG judged that there was probably no important uncertainty or variability. Resources: The resources needed for IRS in humanitarian emergencies are, at a minimum, the same as those needed for delivery of IRS in more stable settings (see “Resources and other considerations” table, section 4.1.1), but the overall cost is likely to be higher due to the various logistical issues noted below. Based on cost data published in 2021 [36] the median economic cost per person protected per year was estimated to be US$ 5.70 in stable settings. As in stable settings, establishing an IRS programme in an area for the first time requires a great amount of resources. In emergency settings, increased costs are assumed to be associated with transporting commodities and personnel to areas where access is limited by geography or conflict, the fact that shorter lead times for procurement generally result in higher cost of goods, and the need to quickly establish capacity (recruitment and training of personnel, establishment of operation sites, i.e. stores, soak pits, and wash areas) to protect the at-risk population and avoid a potential malaria epidemic. The GDG therefore judged that deploying IRS in such settings would likely involve high costs. Data from a review of the cost and cost-effectiveness of malaria control interventions deployed in stable settings [36] reported that the cost-effectiveness of IRS compared to no IRS was US$ 840.44 per death averted and US$ 25.16 per DALY averted. The GDG noted that the cost-effectiveness of deploying IRS is likely to vary depending on the malaria transmission level in the area of deployment and other contextual factors. However, the GDG judged that IRS is likely to be cost-effective compared to no IRS, given the benefits of protecting vulnerable populations from malaria in such settings. Equity: Providing IRS to populations in areas with ongoing malaria transmission affected by humanitarian emergencies was judged by the GDG to result in increased equity by providing the most vulnerable with an effective malaria prevention intervention. Acceptability: No research was identified regarding the acceptability of IRS in emergency settings. Despite the lack of evidence, the GDG judged that IRS is likely to be acceptable to key stakeholders, given that IRS is generally accepted in more stable settings. Feasibility: No evidence was included in the systematic review and no studies were identified by the GDG regarding the feasibility of implementing IRS in humanitarian emergency settings. The GDG judged that the feasibility of IRS would vary, likely depending on whether: • the structures in such settings are amenable to being sprayed; open-sided structures and certain surface materials would not be suitable for spraying; • commodities can be acquired and skilled personnel recruited with the resources available within the given timeframe; • access to the population is feasible, which may involve higher costs than in more stable settings. The GDG noted that IRS may be more feasible in the chronic phase of a humanitarian emergency, when shelter, general infrastructure and human resources are better established than in the acute stages. In the acute phase of an emergency, there may be other competing demands on resources and overall capacity. WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) 71 of 478. Justification: The systematic review [55] (Messenger et al unpublished evidence) included four studies conducted in Pakistan and Sudan that compared IRS versus no IRS on malaria outcomes in areas affected by humanitarian emergencies. The review included only one observational study showing that P. falciparum was reduced, but the certainty of evidence was considered to be very low. One RCT showed no effect of IRS on P. falciparum parasite prevalence (low-certainty evidence). IRS was reported to reduce both P. vivax parasite incidence and prevalence based on two observational studies, but the certainty of evidence was assessed to be very low. All studies were conducted during the chronic phase of the emergency. Deploying IRS in the acute stage of an emergency may differ from employing IRS once some infrastructure has been established, due to numerous logistical challenges. Given that the systematic review only identified and included four studies, a number of potential effect modifiers could not be examined, and the generalizability of the findings was limited. Humanitarian emergencies in other parts of the world may differ in terms of available capacity, infrastructure, community behaviour, and acceptance. As for many vector control interventions, the impact of IRS may vary in different settings depending on a number of factors, such as the behaviour of the mosquito species, the level and mechanism(s) of insecticide resistance in vectors, parasite prevalence, and coverage of IRS in the population. As with deploying IRS in more stable settings, IRS will only be effective where vectors rest primarily indoors and mosquitoes are susceptible to the insecticide being deployed. The review findings provided little evidence of an impact on malaria outcomes in humanitarian emergencies. Given the effectiveness of IRS programmes in reducing malaria burden in more stable settings, however, the GDG judged that the desirable effects of deploying IRS compared to no IRS in humanitarian emergencies would likely outweigh the undesirable effects. Given the low certainty of the evidence, the panel felt that the recommendation should be classified as conditional. Considerations of feasibility and the cost and cost-effectiveness of implementing IRS in such settings were viewed by the GDG as important. In humanitarian emergencies, the shelters provided may not be amenable to spraying and there may be higher costs associated with deploying IRS in such settings than in more stable ones.

    "content": "In humanitarian emergencies, the shelters provided may not be amenable to spraying, and there may be higher costs associated with deploying IRS in such settings than in more stable ones. Research needs: WHO encourages funding of high-quality research to generate further evidence on: the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences of IRS in the acute phase of humanitarian emergencies (where logistics and priorities may differ); and contextual factors (i.e. acceptability, feasibility, resource use, cost-effectiveness, equity, values and preferences) related to IRS deployed in humanitarian emergencies. 4.1.2 Co-deploying ITNs and IRS – Practical info: Given the resource constraints across malaria-endemic countries, the deployment of a second vector control intervention on top of optimal coverage with an existing one should only be considered as part of a broader prioritization analysis aimed at achieving maximum impact with the available resources. In many settings, a switch from ITNs to IRS or vice versa, rather than their combination, is likely to be the only financially feasible option. Deployment of either intervention needs to ensure optimal coverage of populations at risk of malaria and ensure they are delivered to a high standard. Further guidance on best practices for ensuring high-quality deployment of interventions is provided in the Operational manual on indoor residual spraying: control of vectors of malaria, Aedes-borne diseases, Chagas disease, leishmaniases and lymphatic filariasis [66] and in the Alliance for Malaria Prevention toolkit. Conditional recommendation for Moderate certainty evidence: Prioritize optimal coverage with either ITNs or IRS over combination (2019). The co-deployment of ITNs and IRS is not recommended for prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission. Priority should be given to delivering either ITNs or IRS at optimal coverage and to a high standard, rather than introducing the second intervention as a means to compensate for deficiencies in the implementation of the first intervention. In settings where optimal ITN coverage, as specified in the strategic plan, has been achieved and where ITNs remain effective, additionally implementing IRS may have limited utility in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality. Given the resource constraints across malaria endemic countries, it is recommended that effort be focused on good-quality implementation of either ITNs or IRS, rather than deploying both in the same area. However, the combination of these interventions may be considered for resistance prevention, mitigation or management should sufficient resources be available. Evidence to decision Justification: The systematic review published in 2019 [85] on the deployment of IRS in combination with ITNs (specifically pyrethroid-only LLINs) provided evidence that, in settings where there is optimal coverage with ITNs and where these remain effective, IRS may have limited utility in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality. A systematic review comparing the impact of IRS to ITNs against malaria from a trial carried out in the United Republic of Tanzania reported variable results, and concluded that there was little difference between the two [86]. WHO guidance was developed accordingly to emphasize the need for good-quality implementation of either ITNs or IRS, rather than deploying both in the same area [87]. However, the co-deployment of these interventions may be considered for resistance prevention, mitigation or management should sufficient resources be available. Insecticide resistance threatens the effectiveness of insecticidal interventions and hence is a key consideration in determining which vector control interventions to select to ensure maximum impact. One approach to the prevention, mitigation and management of vector insecticide resistance is the co-deployment (or combination) of interventions with different insecticides (see Section 4.1 on “Prevention, mitigation and management of insecticide resistance”). Therefore, WHO guidance developed based on the systematic review [85] differentiates between the effect of combined interventions on malaria morbidity and mortality versus the utility of this approach in a resistance management strategy [87]. A summary of the conclusions (with minor updates for clarity) used to develop the above recommendations is as follows: In settings with high ITN coverage where ITNs remain effective, IRS may have limited utility in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality. However, IRS may be implemented as part of an IRM strategy in areas where ITNs are in use [21]. Malaria control and elimination programmes should prioritize the delivery of ITNs or IRS at optimal coverage and to a high standard, rather than introducing the second intervention as a means to compensate for deficiencies in the implementation of the first intervention. If ITNs and IRS are to be deployed together in the same geographical location, IRS should be conducted with a non-pyrethroid insecticide. Evidence is needed to determine the effectiveness of combining IRS and ITNs in malaria transmission foci, including in low transmission settings. Evidence is also needed from different eco-epidemiological settings outside of Africa. All programmes in any transmission setting that decide to prioritize the combined deployment of ITNs and IRS over other potential use of their financial resources should include a rigorous programme of M&E (e.g. a stepped wedge introduction of the combination) in order to confirm whether the additional inputs are having the desired impact. Countries that are already using both interventions should similarly undertake an evaluation of the effectiveness of the combination versus either ITNs or IRS alone. Benefits and harms: No benefit of adding IRS to areas where pyrethroid-only ITNs are being used was identified in systematic review. In areas of confirmed pyrethroid resistance, IRS with a non-pyrethroid insecticide may increase effectiveness against malaria. No undesirable effects were identified in systematic review. However, the cost of combining two interventions will significantly increase commodity and operational costs. Moderate Certainty of the evidence: The certainty of evidence identified in the systematic review showing no benefit to adding IRS in situations where ITNs are already being used was graded as moderate. Resources and other considerations: The degree of pyrethroid resistance and its impact on the effectiveness of pyrethroid-only ITNs should be considered. The status of vector resistance to the proposed IRS active ingredient needs to be known. In resource-constrained situations, it is unlikely to be financially feasible to deploy both ITNs and IRS. The approach of co-deploying interventions for resistance management was developed largely based on experience with agricultural pest management, and the evidence base from public health remains weak. Research needs: Further evidence is needed on the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection).",

    "content": "The approach of co-deploying interventions for resistance management was developed largely based on experience with agricultural pest management, and the evidence base from public health remains weak. Research needs: Further evidence is needed on the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms and/or unintended consequences of co-deploying non-pyrethroid IRS with ITNs versus ITNs only in areas with insecticide-resistant mosquito populations. Determine whether there are comparative benefits (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection), as well as potential harms/unintended consequences of combining non-pyrethroid IRS with ITNs versus IRS only in areas with insecticide-resistant mosquito populations. Determine the acceptability of co-deploying IRS and ITNs among householders and communities. Evaluate new tools for monitoring the quality of IRS and ITN interventions. Practical info: Financial considerations such as cost and cost-effectiveness are major drivers of decision-making, and the selection of malaria vector control interventions and determination of their coverage should thus be embedded in a prioritization process that considers the cost and effectiveness of all available malaria interventions and aims at achieving maximum impact with the available resources. Evaluations of the relative cost and cost-effectiveness of ITNs and IRS are ongoing to inform revision of the guidelines. Justification: ITNs can provide both personal and community-level protection when nets are deployed at the community rather than individual level, with the aim of providing sufficient nets to cover all household inhabitants. Similarly, IRS will have a greater effect on mosquito populations and therefore transmission if deployed at high coverage. It is therefore important to maximize access to ITNs or IRS in communities that are at risk of malaria. This will involve quantification of needs to enable access for all household inhabitants when placing procurement orders and putting in place appropriate delivery structures. For malaria vector control interventions recommended for large-scale deployment, namely ITNs and IRS, optimal coverage refers to providing populations at risk of malaria with access to ITNs coupled with health promotion to maximize use and ensuring timely replacement; or providing these populations with regular application of IRS. Either intervention should be deployed at a level that provides the best value for money while reflecting programmatic realities. In practice, this often means quantifying commodities to provide full access by the population at risk, while realizing that this will not result in 100% coverage or 100% access due to various system inefficiencies. Being cognizant of such constraints, decision-making should then consider other alternatives as part of the intervention package, ranging from chemoprevention to supplementary vector control, instead of pursuing the idealistic goal of providing full population coverage. In terms of the relative effectiveness of IRS compared to pyrethroid-only ITNs, a systematic review published in 2010 [86] reported low-certainty evidence that, in areas of intense malaria transmission, IRS may be associated with lower malaria incidence, but no effect was evident for parasite prevalence. In areas of unstable transmission, ITNs may be associated with lower malaria incidence and prevalence; however, the certainty of evidence was determined to be very low. The panel therefore could not provide a definitive conclusion on the comparative effectiveness of these interventions. WHO currently views these two interventions as being equally effective ways of delivering an insecticide. The actual effectiveness in reducing the burden of malaria is dependent on the insecticide(s) used on the ITN or applied by IRS. Decisions on whether to deploy IRS or ITNs need to be informed by a number of factors, such as data on insecticide resistance, past and present experience of using interventions (including feasibility of deployment and acceptability and use by end-users), vector behaviours and the current options available within the context. Given these various considerations, the wide range of different contexts and the lack of correlation between insecticide resistance data assessed using bioassays and the actual effectiveness of an insecticidal intervention in controlling vectors, no general recommendation to guide the selection of ITNs over IRS can be made. Practice Statement: Access to ITNs or IRS at optimal coverage levels (2019): Access to effective vector control using ITNs or IRS at optimal coverage levels should be ensured for all populations at risk of malaria in most epidemiological and ecological settings. Practical info: Access to effective vector control interventions will need to be maintained in the majority of countries and locations where malaria control has been effective. This includes settings with ongoing malaria transmission, as well as those in which transmission has been interrupted but some level of receptivity and importation risk remains. Malaria elimination is defined as the interruption of local transmission (reduction to zero incidence of indigenous cases) of a specified malaria parasite species in a defined geographical area as a result of deliberate intervention activities. Following elimination, continued measures to prevent re-establishment of transmission are usually required [30]. Interventions are no longer required once eradication has been achieved. Malaria eradication is defined as the permanent reduction to zero of the worldwide incidence of infection caused by all human malaria parasite species as a result of deliberate activities. There is a critical need for all countries with ongoing malaria transmission, and in particular those approaching elimination, to build and maintain strong capacity in disease and entomological surveillance and health systems. The capacity to detect and respond to possible resurgences with appropriate vector control relies on having the necessary entomological information (i.e. susceptibility status of vectors to insecticides, as well as their biting and resting preferences). Such capacity is also required for the detailed assessment of malariogenic potential, which is a pre-condition for determining whether vector control can be scaled back (or focalized). If areas where transmission has been interrupted are identified, the decision to scale back vector control should be based on a detailed analysis that includes assessment of the receptivity and importation risk of the area, as well as an assessment of the active disease surveillance system, and capacity for case management and vector control response. Justification: A comprehensive review of historical evidence and mathematical simulation modelling undertaken for WHO in 2015 indicated that the scale-back of malaria vector control was associated with a high probability of malaria resurgence, including for most scenarios in areas where malaria transmission was very low or had been interrupted [88]. Both the historical review and the simulation modelling clearly indicated that the risk of resurgence was significantly greater at higher EIRs and case importation rates, and...",

Both the historical review and the simulation modelling clearly indicated that the risk of resurgence was significantly greater at higher EIRs and case importation rates, and lower coverage of active case detection and case management.\nOnce transmission has been reduced to very low levels approaching elimination, ensuring optimal access to vector control for at-risk populations remains a priority, even though the size and demographics of the at-risk populations may change as malaria transmission is reduced.\nAs malaria incidence falls and elimination is approached, increasing heterogeneity in transmission will result in foci with ongoing transmission in which vector control may need to be optimized and enhanced. Such foci may be the result of particularly high vectorial capacity, lapsed prevention and treatment services, changes in parasites that make the current strategies less effective, or reintroduction of malaria parasites by the movement of infected people or infected mosquitoes. Monitoring the coverage, quality and impact of vector control interventions is essential to maintain the effectiveness of control. Guidance on entomological surveillance across the continuum from control to elimination is provided elsewhere [30].\nOnce elimination has been achieved, vector control may need to be continued by targeting defined at-risk populations to prevent reintroduction or re-establishment of local transmission.\nIt is acknowledged that malaria transmission can persist following the implementation of a widely effective malaria programme.\nThe sources and risks of residual transmission may vary by location, time and the existing components of the current malaria programme. This variation is potentially due to a combination of both mosquito and human behaviours, such as when people live in or visit forest areas or do not sleep in protected houses, or when local mosquito vector species bite and/or rest outdoors and thereby avoid contact with IRS or ITNs/LLINs.\nOnce elimination has been achieved, optimal vector control coverage should be maintained in receptive areas where there is a substantial risk of reintroduction.\nPractice Statement\nNo scale-back in areas with ongoing local malaria transmission (2019)\nIn areas with ongoing local malaria transmission (irrespective of both the pre-intervention and current level of transmission), vector control interventions should not be scaled back. Ensuring access to effective malaria vector control at optimal levels for all inhabitants of such areas should be pursued and maintained.\nWHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO)\n75 of 478\n--- Page Break ---\n4.1.3 Supplementary interventions\nLarval source management (LSM)\nLSM in the context of malaria control is the management of water bodies that are potential larval habitats for mosquitoes. Such management of water bodies is conducted to prevent the development of the immature stages (eggs, larvae and pupae) and hence the production of adult mosquitoes, with the overall aim of preventing or controlling transmission of malaria. There are four types of LSM:\n• habitat modification: a permanent alteration to the environment, e.g. land reclamation, filling of water bodies;\n• habitat manipulation: a recurrent activity, e.g. flushing of streams, drain clearance;\n• larviciding: the regular application of biological or chemical insecticides to water bodies; and\n• biological control: the introduction of natural predators into water bodies.\nTopical repellents and insecticide-treated clothing\nTopical repellents and insecticide-treated clothing have been proposed as potential methods for preventing malaria in areas where the mosquito vectors bite or rest outdoors, or bite in the early evening or early morning when people are not within housing structures. These methods have also been proposed for specific population groups, such as those who live or work away from permanent housing structures (e.g. migrants, refugees, internally displaced persons, military personnel) or those who work outdoors at night. In these situations, the effectiveness of ITNs or IRS may be reduced. Repellents have also been proposed for use in high-risk groups, such as pregnant mothers. Despite the potential to provide individual protection against bites from malaria vectors, the deployment of the above personal protection methods in large-scale public health campaigns has been limited, at least partially due to the scarcity of evidence of their public health value. Daily compliance and appropriate use of repellents seem to be major obstacles to achieving such potential impact [89][90]. Individuals’ use of the intervention to achieve personal protection faces the same obstacles.\nSpatial emanators\nSpatial emanators, also called spatial repellents, are a category of vector control interventions designed to reduce human exposure to disease-carrying mosquitoes by dispersing volatile active ingredients into the surrounding air. These interventions function by deterring mosquitoes from entering a treated space and/or disrupting their ability to locate and bite human hosts.\nSpatial emanators may be deployed as a supplementary measure alongside established vector control strategies, such as ITNs and IRS, particularly in settings where these primary interventions face limitations, such as in humanitarian emergencies.\nSpatial emanators can be broadly categorized into passive and active types based on their method of dispersal. Passive emanators, such as volatile pyrethroid-based devices, release active ingredients at ambient temperatures and rely on natural air movement for dispersal of the active ingredient, without the need for heat or electricity. By contrast, active emanators, including mosquito coils, liquid electrics and vaporizing mats, rely on daily activation by end-users and/or a source of electricity, which may not be continuously available to populations most at risk of malaria. Active emanators are already being used by some households, particularly in regions where mosquitoes exhibit outdoor or early-evening biting behaviours that reduce the efficacy of IRS and ITNs.\nAmong spatial emanators, mosquito coils are the most widely used household insecticidal product globally, with billions of units sold each year. Coils containing pyrethroid-based compounds such as transfluthrin and metofluthrin have demonstrated the ability to deter mosquitoes and, in some cases, reduce malaria transmission. Passive emanators may provide a long-lasting effect without requiring combustion or electricity, making them suitable for continuous protection indoors or in semi-enclosed spaces.\nPrevious evaluations of spatial emanators highlighted the need for further evidence to support their use for malaria control. A 2019 review [89] determined that, while these interventions showed promise in reducing mosquito bites, the available data were insufficient to warrant a formal recommendation. However, recent studies have provided new insights into the potential role of spatial emanators in integrated vector management.\nTo date, preliminary research has considered spatial emanators to provide the following benefits:",

    "content": "review [89] determined that, while these interventions showed promise in reducing mosquito bites, the available data were insufficient to warrant a formal recommendation. However, recent studies have provided new insights into the potential role of spatial emanators in integrated vector management. To date, preliminary research has considered spatial emanators to provide the following benefits: • They are easy to use: Deployment of spatial emanators requires minimal user effort (compared to ITNs) and minimal training for deployment (compared to IRS). • They require low personal compliance: Spatial emanators do not require high levels of daily personal compliance. • They are easily deployable: Products are designed to be lightweight and portable, facilitating rapid deployment and scalability in diverse settings, which may include nomadic or unstable housing conditions. Space spraying refers to the release of fast-acting insecticides into the air as smoke or as fine droplets as a method to reduce the numbers of adult mosquitoes in dwellings and also outdoors. Application methods include thermal fogging; cold aerosol distribution by handheld or backpack sprayers, ground vehicles or aerial means; and repetitious spraying by two or more sprays in quick succession. Space spraying is most often deployed in response to epidemics or outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease, such as dengue. Housing modifications In the context of malaria control, housing modifications are defined as any structural changes, pre- or post-construction, of a house that prevents the entry of mosquitoes and/or decreases exposure of inhabitants to vectors with the aim of preventing or reducing the transmission of malaria. Housing modifications may encompass a wide range of interventions – from those made at the outset in the structural design of the house and the choice of materials used, to modifications made to existing homes, such as the screening or closure of gaps. In 2018, the WHO Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health published the WHO Housing and health guidelines [91]. This document brings together the most recent evidence to provide practical recommendations for reducing the health burden due to unsafe and substandard housing. The review concluded that improved housing conditions have the potential to save lives, prevent disease, increase quality of life, reduce poverty, and help mitigate climate change. It was, however, noted that further evidence was needed on the impact of improved housing in preventing vector-borne diseases. Available evidence indicates that poor-quality housing and neglected peri-domestic environments are risk factors for the transmission of a number of vector-borne diseases such as malaria, arboviral diseases (e.g. dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika virus disease), Chagas disease and leishmaniasis [92]. Together with metal roofs, ceilings, and finished interior walls, the closing of open eaves, screening of doors and windows with fly screens or mosquito netting, and filling of holes and cracks in walls and roofs may reduce the mosquitoes’ entry points into houses and potentially reduce transmission of malaria and other vector-borne diseases. A recent review indicated that housing quality is an important risk factor for malaria infection across the spectrum of malaria endemicity in sub-Saharan Africa [93]. Structural housing interventions that may reduce exposure of inhabitants to mosquitoes fall largely into two categories: 1. Primary house construction: • house designs, such as elevating houses (e.g. using stilts) and using fewer or smaller windows; • construction materials, such as cement or brick walls, corrugated iron roofing, door designs with fewer openings, and closure of eaves that minimize entry holes for mosquitoes. 2. Modifications to existing house designs: • non-insecticidal interventions, which include screening and covering potential entry points, filling eaves with mud, sand, rubble or cement, installing ceilings and conducting wall maintenance to fill in any cracks; • insecticidal interventions, which include insecticidal screening of mosquito entry points, particularly eaves, and the installation of lethal house lures. Housing modifications are likely to be most effective against mosquitoes that display endophilic and/or endophagic behaviours (i.e. indoor resting and feeding, respectively). Practical info Larviciding is most likely to be cost-effective in urban areas where the appropriate conditions are more likely to be present. Larviciding is not generally recommended in rural settings, unless there are particular circumstances limiting the larval habitats and specific evidence confirming that such measures can reduce malaria incidence in the local setting. Determining whether or not specific habitats have immature Anopheles larvae and are suitable for larviciding is essential and should be based on expert technical opinion and knowledge. WHO's 2013 operational manual on larval source management [98] concluded that ITNs and IRS remain the backbone of malaria vector control, but LSM represents an additional (supplementary) strategy for malaria control in Africa. Larviciding will generally be most effective in areas where larval habitats are few, fixed and findable, and likely less feasible in areas where the aquatic habitats are abundant, scattered and variable. Determination of whether or not specific habitats are suitable for larviciding should be based on assessment by an entomologist. The WHO operational manual focuses on sub-Saharan Africa, but the principles espoused are likely to hold for other geographic regions that fit the same criteria. The following settings are potentially the most suitable for larviciding as a supplementary measure implemented alongside ITNs or IRS: • urban areas, where breeding sites are relatively few, fixed and findable in relation to houses (which are targeted for ITNs or IRS); and • arid regions, where larval habitats may be few and fixed throughout much of the year. Larviciding is likely to be more acceptable in communities that have a good understanding of the lifecycle of mosquitoes and the link with the transmission of malaria or other diseases. Community members may have concerns about larvicides being applied to drinking water or other domestic water sources. A well-designed community sensitization programme is required to ensure that communities fully understand the intervention and that any concerns about health and safety aspects are addressed. Evidence to decision Conditional recommendation for , Low certainty evidence Larviciding (2019) Insecticides can be regularly applied to water bodies (larviciding) for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults as a supplementary intervention to ITNs or IRS in areas with ongoing malaria transmission where aquatic habitats are few, fixed and findable. The conditionality of this recommendation is due to the low certainty of evidence, the impact being limited to non-extensive habitats, and concerns about feasibility.

The conditionality of this recommendation is due to the low certainty of evidence, the impact being limited to non-extensive habitats, and concerns about feasibility. When considering larviciding, programmes should note the following:\n• Larviciding only reduces vector density and so does not have the same potential for health impact as ITNs and IRS; ITNs provide protection from biting vectors and both ITNs and IRS reduce adult longevity.\n• Larviciding should not be seen as a substitute for ITNs or IRS or a means to fill a coverage gap in areas with significant malaria risk; rather, larviciding represents a potential supplementary strategy for malaria control.\n• Feasibility and cost-effectiveness should be taken into account; larviciding will generally be most cost-effective in areas where larval habitats are few, fixed and findable, and likely less feasible in areas where the aquatic habitats are abundant, scattered and variable.\nThe following settings are potentially the most suitable for larviciding as a supplementary measure implemented alongside ITNs or IRS:\n• urban areas, where breeding sites are relatively few, fixed and findable in relation to houses (which are targeted for ITNs or IRS); and\n• arid regions, where larval habitats may be few and fixed throughout much of the year.\nBenefits and harms: The systematic review [97] reported that larviciding for non‐extensive larval habitats less than 1km² may have an effect in reducing malaria incidence (rate ratio: 0.24; one trial; low-certainty evidence) and parasite prevalence (risk ratio: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.71–0.89; two studies; low-certainty evidence) compared to no larviciding. However, it is not known whether larviciding has an effect on malaria incidence (OR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.39–2.81; one study; very low-certainty evidence) or parasite prevalence (OR: 1.49; 95% CI: 0.45–4.93; one study; very low-certainty evidence) compared to no larviciding in large‐scale aquatic habitats.\nNo undesirable effects were identified in the systematic review. However, larviciding may affect non-target fauna; communities may not accept its application to sources of drinking water or water used for other domestic purposes.\nLow Certainty of the Evidence: For larval habitats less than 1km², the systematic review assessed that the overall certainty of evidence that larviciding has an impact on malaria was low. In larger habitats, the certainty of evidence was judged to be very low.\nResources and Other Considerations: The list below compiled by the GDG lists resources that should be considered for implementing larviciding. Note that this list does not include resource needs for product selection or assessment of impact of the intervention.\nStaff: • Competent, trained, supervised and adequately remunerated larvicide operators and skilled entomological technicians, divided into separate teams for surveillance and application of larvicide • Transport logisticians and drivers • Stock managers • Mapping technicians and assistants • Environmental assessment support staff\nTraining: • Anopheles larval habitat identification and classification • Larvicide application and safety • Entomological sampling and identification of Anopheles mosquito larvae, pupae and adults • Training for awareness campaigns and to encourage acceptability\nTransport: • Appropriate vehicles to provide transport of larvicide, equipment, entomological sampling materials and workers to the community • Vehicle maintenance costs • Fuel\nSupplies: • PPE • Larvicides • Entomological supplies for larval monitoring and rearing/maintenance adult mosquitoes\nEquipment: • Larvicide application equipment • Larvae, pupae and adult monitoring equipment • Mosquito identification equipment, e.g. microscopes • Computer/communication equipment\nInfrastructure: • Appropriate storage facilities for larvicide and equipment • Office space for management • Insectary for collected larvae and to rear/maintain mosquitoes\nJustification: Larviciding is deployed for malaria control in several countries, including Somalia and Sudan. However, the systematic review on larviciding conducted in 2019 [97] assessed that the certainty of evidence of impact on malaria incidence or parasite prevalence was moderate or low in non-extensive habitats. Since larviciding only reduces vector density, it does not have the same potential for health impact as ITNs and IRS – both of which reduce vector longevity (a key determinant of transmission intensity) and provide protection from biting vectors. As a result, larviciding should never be seen as a substitute for ITNs or IRS in areas with significant malaria risk.\nResearch needs: • Further evidence is needed on the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences of larviciding. • Evaluate new technologies for identifying aquatic habitats.\nPractical Info: Although the available evidence that met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review was considered insufficient to develop specific recommendations, national programmes may decide to use environmental management (habitat modification and/or manipulation) to avoid the creation, and reduce the availability of, larval habitats, where deemed appropriate based on expert guidance and local knowledge. If such strategies are employed, the selection of the specific intervention(s) should be highly contextual, i.e. it should take into account the specific environment, the types of interventions relevant to that environment, the resources needed and their availability, the feasibility of the intervention(s), acceptability by local stakeholders and potential impact on equity. The selection should also take into account previous experience either gained locally or from other areas of similar ecological and epidemiological characteristics where such intervention(s) have been implemented. Additionally, the selection of the comparator should consider other interventions that are known to be cost-effective, for example, larviciding. Where the decision is taken to invest resources into larval habitat modification and/or larval habitat manipulation, the intervention(s) should be designed and conducted with the explicit aim of generating data to demonstrate effective malaria control, preferably supported with environmental and entomological data as secondary end-points. When assessing the impact of environmental management against malaria, it is important that the testing of the intervention(s) under investigation be conducted specifically for the purpose of preventing or controlling malaria by reducing the availability and productivity of larval habitats. For example, dams are generally constructed for water management, irrigation or power production purposes, not for malaria control. In fact, in some cases, their construction may result in increased larval production due to the creation of standing water bodies.

In fact, in some cases, their construction may result in increased larval production due to the creation of standing water bodies. The controlled release of water from the impoundment of a dam, however, is considered an example of habitat manipulation – a recurrent activity that potentially controls mosquito larvae by increasing the flow rate of downstream water with the aim of preventing mosquito development and so controlling malaria transmission. This is one example of the multitude of interventions that fall under the broad category of larval habitat modification and/or manipulation. To be able to generate evidence on the efficacy of larval habitat modification and/or manipulation in preventing malaria, and to facilitate the interpretation of the evidence once generated, it is important to well define the interventions that are being evaluated and, importantly, compare how the water conditions of larval habitats at the intervention and control sites are affected. For example, if the intervention aimed to increase the water flow to downstream areas, the evaluation should include an assessment of whether this was achieved, the extent to which this impacted the development of the immature and adult stages of the mosquito, and, ultimately, whether there was an epidemiological impact against malaria in the intervention arms compared to control areas. This information will then support the evolution of WHO guidance in this area and, ultimately, guide the choice and implementation of efficacious interventions.\n\nCommunication:\n• Communication with other ministries and sectors e.g. environment, transport, ministry of works/other infrastructure sectors and city/local councils\n• Communication with the general public e.g. through the education sector and media for awareness campaigns and to encourage acceptability\n• Communication with the community/local leaders\n\nGovernance/programme management:\n• Supervision of mapping and application\n• Supervision of standard monitoring of larval, pupal and adult populations to assess entomological impact\n• Environmental impact assessment supervision\n\nLarval habitat modification and/or larval habitat manipulation (2021): No recommendation can be made because the evidence on the effectiveness of a specific larval habitat modification and/or larval habitat manipulation intervention for the prevention and control of malaria was deemed to be insufficient.\n\nEvidence to decision - Justification: The systematic review (Martello et al unpublished evidence) to inform WHO recommendations in this area identified only two controlled before-after studies meeting the inclusion criteria with epidemiological outcomes that investigated the impact of larval habitat manipulation alone. No studies investigating the impact of larval habitat modification on malaria outcomes were identified. Two other identified studies combined habitat manipulation with larviciding and so the effect of the two could not be separated. One study was conducted in an urban area of The Philippines in 1960 and the other in a forested area of India in 2008 where annual IRS was also conducted. The studies provided low- or very low-certainty evidence that the controlled release of water from flood gates of dams to discharge excess water or using spillways (overflow channels) across streams to automatically flush downstream areas with water (continually or intermittently) reduced clinical malaria incidence or parasite prevalence. The evidence was downgraded due to the lack of appropriate randomization or poor statistical reporting. The studies examined very specific interventions, each studied in a single site, which the GDG judged would limit their generalizability. The systematic review reported a number of other studies with only entomological outcomes investigating a wide range of highly heterogeneous interventions falling under the broad term of larval habitat manipulation and/or modification, some of which may only be appropriate in specific ecologies. Given the broad range of interventions and settings in which larval habitat manipulation and/or modification may be applied, the GDG judged that the potential impact, feasibility, acceptability and resource needs for each intervention are likely to be highly variable. Although it is acknowledged that there is a wealth of historical research on environmental management of malaria, the literature did not meet the eligibility criteria to be included in this systematic review. Therefore, there remains a continued need to robustly demonstrate the epidemiological impact of environmental management (habitat modification and/or manipulation) on malaria incidence and prevalence through further well-designed intervention studies.\n\nBenefits and harms: The systematic review (Martello et al unpublished evidence) identified two studies that investigated the impact of habitat manipulation by controlling the release of water from flood gates of dams or spillways (overflow channels) across streams to flush downstream areas with water against malaria. It is unknown whether larval habitat manipulation has an effect on malaria parasite prevalence compared to no larval habitat manipulation (relative risk: 0.01; 95% CI: 0.0–0.16; one study; very low-certainty evidence). It is unknown whether larval habitat manipulation combined with IRS has an effect on malaria clinical incidence compared to IRS alone (odds ratios or relative risks could not be calculated because the numbers of participants in each arm or at follow-up were not reported; one study; very low-certainty evidence). Both studies were conducted in very specific settings. No undesirable effects were identified in the systematic review.\n\nCertainty of the evidence (Very low): The systematic review assessed that the overall certainty of evidence that larval habitat manipulation had an impact on malaria was very low.\n\nValues and preferences: No research was identified to determine preference and values. The GDG judged that there was probably no important uncertainty or variability.\n\nResources and other considerations: No research was identified that assessed cost effectiveness or resource needs.\n\nResearch needs: The GDG encourages funding of high-quality research on the impact of habitat manipulation and/or modification on malaria transmission to inform the development of specific WHO recommendations in this area. A number of evidence gaps and associated requirements were identified: • Determine the impact (incidence of clinical malaria and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences of the different interventions. • Epidemiological evidence is required on the efficacy against malaria of the same intervention implemented in different settings (where vector species may differ). • Detailed descriptions are needed of the interventions deployed, as well as larval habitat types and vector species targeted. The impact of the intervention on the water conditions of the larval habitats should be assessed, i.e. properties of the habitat.",

The GDG recognized that there are specific settings in which the intervention is currently implemented, and in these specific settings programme staff consider it to be effective. In some of the settings where larvivorous fish are being deployed, programmatic evidence exists; however, this was not determined appropriate for inclusion in the systematic review due to unsuitable study design or other concerns.

The review reported that there was no clear evidence of an effect on larval densities (very low-certainty evidence), but larvivorous fish may reduce the number of habitats positive for anopheline larvae (low-certainty evidence). The GDG noted that fish can serve as an additional source of nutrition. No undesirable effects were identified in the systematic review. The GDG recognized that there are specific settings in which the intervention is currently implemented, and in these specific settings programme staff consider it to be effective.\nCertainty of the evidence\nThe systematic review did not identify any eligible studies demonstrating the effect of larvivorous fish on malaria transmission or disease outcomes.\nResources and other considerations\n• There is evidence that this intervention would require mosquito aquatic habitats to be large, permanent and few.\n• Local capacity for breeding fish, maintaining fish and monitoring aquatic habitats would be needed.\n• The characteristics of settings in which this intervention might be applicable would be needed.\nWHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) 82 of 478\nEvidence to decision\nConditional recommendation against, Low certainty evidence\nTopical repellents (2023)\nThe deployment of topical repellents in areas with ongoing malaria transmission is not recommended if the aim is to prevent and control malaria at the community level.\nThe panel recommended against the implementation of topical repellents if the main aim is to control malaria at the community level, given the lack of evidence of significant impact. To achieve community-level impact, it is likely that a high level of individual compliance would be needed. The panel noted that topical repellents may, however, offer protection for individuals and for high-risk groups who do not benefit from other vector control interventions; however, studies demonstrating impact against malaria at the individual level or in specific risk groups are required to support a formal recommendation.\nBenefits and harms The systematic review [90] included eight studies that measured the impact of deploying topical repellents in communities in terms of malaria outcomes. However, only six of these were included in the meta-analysis (five cRCTs and one RCT). Two studies were included in the narrative synthesis but excluded from the meta-analysis, because the authors were unable to extract the data for their inclusion in the latter. Studies were carried out among residents of all ages in Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Cambodia, Ecuador, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Peru and the United Republic of Tanzania, and in specific populations in Pakistan and Thailand (refugees). None of the studies carried out where Plasmodium vivax was being transmitted cleared infections at the start and so only outcomes for P. falciparum were included.\nEffect on malaria incidence\nFour studies (three cRCTs and one RCT) reported the effect of topical repellents on malaria incidence. Three of them measured infection incidence six months after deploying topical repellents, and one study reported case incidence after 12 months. No significant reductions in infection and case incidence were seen with the use of topical repellents (infection IRR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.56–1.02; low-certainty evidence; case IRR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.32–1.36; low-certainty evidence). Combining the studies showed a small but significant effect on malaria case incidence and infection incidence (IRR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.56–0.98; low-certainty evidence).\nEffect on malaria prevalence\nFour studies (three cRCTs and one RCT) reported the effect of topical repellents on malaria prevalence and showed that their use was associated with a significant effect (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.67–0.97; low-certainty evidence).\nEffects in high-risk groups\nSubgroup analyses were carried out to compare high-risk groups and non-high-risk groups in terms of the effect of topical repellents on malaria incidence and prevalence outcomes. A non-significant reduction in malaria incidence was observed based on three studies carried out in high-risk populations (IRR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.58–1.01). No significant effect was shown from the single study of malaria incidence carried out in non-high-risk populations (IRR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.02–1.4). All studies reporting outcomes of malaria prevalence included at least some individuals classified as being at high risk for malaria, although two of the studies were carried out in refugee camps where all participants were at high risk. Subgroup analyses separating studies in which repellents were distributed in refugee camps from those carried out in other settings showed a significant reduction in malaria prevalence in refugee camps (OR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.44–0.86), whereas no effect was seen in studies conducted outside of such camps (OR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.73–1.11).\nEffects in individually randomized studies\nSubgroup analyses indicated no significant effect on malaria incidence when participants were individually randomized to treatment arms (IRR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.49–1.04) or when randomization took place at the cluster level (IRR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.51–1.18); however, only a small number of studies were included.\nWHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) 83 of 478\nJustification\nThe systematic review [90] looked at the protective effect of topical repellents reported in terms of overall incidence or prevalence",

Justification The systematic review [90] looked at the protective effect of topical repellents reported in terms of overall incidence or prevalence of malaria in those communities that received topical repellents and in individuals who were randomly assigned to receive them. However, only a single study was identified that randomly assigned topical repellents to individuals and no significant impact against malaria incidence was reported. For this study and most of the community-randomized studies included in the review, adherence to the topical repellent was reported to be low. More studies are needed to assess whether topical repellents confer individual protection against malaria, where outcomes are linked to adequate application of topical repellents (i.e. regular application in sufficient amounts to exposed skin). The effect of topical repellents on individuals can sometimes be identified in community-randomized studies by comparing the individuals assigned to the intervention who adhered to the assignment and used the product and those who were assigned to not use the product and therefore did not use it. Such analyses, generally termed “per-protocol” analyses, could be examined to better contextualize the individual benefits of topical repellents, even when the overarching trial goals were to provide evidence on community-level impact. The GDG concluded that further evidence is needed to show a significant impact against malaria for communities receiving topical repellents. They also noted that the lack of evidence of an impact against malaria in many of the studies could be attributed to low individual compliance to topical repellents and/or insufficient regular application of the product. Adverse events A total of 283 adverse events (0.6%) were reported from the cRCT and RCT studies, with all events relating to mild skin irritation. The GDG judged these to be few and mild. Low Certainty of the evidence. The overall certainty of the evidence was judged to be low. Values and preferences No research was identified regarding preferences and values. The GDG judged that there was probably no important uncertainty or variability. Resources No research was identified that assessed cost, cost-effectiveness or resource needs. Equity No studies were identified that addressed the issue of whether topical repellents increased or decreased health equity. Acceptability Although the systematic review did not report the acceptability of topical repellents, levels of adherence to intervention estimates were included. In general, adherence was heterogeneous and varied depending on how it was assessed. Methods included self-reporting by participants, observations by study staff and a combination of the two in some studies. Observation methods varied from estimating the weight of returned repellent bottles, counting the number of bottles issued and randomly smelling participants’ skin to determine whether the repellent had been applied. Three studies reported very high adherence in the intervention group (90–98%); however, comparisons between self-reported and observed adherence levels showed large differences, with generally higher self-reported rates. The review also reported variation in self-reported adherence in the two studies conducted on participants from the same trial. This variation was attributed to how participants were questioned about use. The GDG noted that adherence to topical repellents with regular and adequate application is likely to be required for impact against malaria. Feasibility No evidence was included in the review regarding how feasible it would be to deploy topical repellents. For studies in which treatment arms were randomized at the cluster or community level, the systematic review reported no significant effect of topical repellents in terms of reducing P. falciparum infection incidence or case incidence when these outcomes were evaluated separately (infection IRR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.56–1.02; low-certainty evidence; case IRR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.32–1.36; low-certainty evidence). Combining data from these few studies showed a small but significant effect on malaria incidence (combined case and infection IRR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.56–0.98); however, the certainty of evidence was graded as low. A significant effect of topical repellents was observed against malaria prevalence (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.67–0.97); however, the certainty of evidence was graded as low due to concerns over risk of bias, imprecision and indirectness present in the studies included. The review reported that any protective effect was likely driven by two large studies that were included in the analysis; these were carried out in refugee camps where the populations did not have access to ITNs. These findings suggest that topical repellents may have a beneficial effect in the prevention of malaria in certain high-risk groups who may be unlikely to benefit from traditional vector control strategies. More studies in high-risk populations, with and without traditional vector control interventions, are required to determine whether the use of topical repellents is beneficial in such settings. The GDG concluded that while topical repellents have been shown to prevent mosquito bites, there was insufficient evidence to determine whether they have an effect on malaria at the community or individual level. Further studies are needed to determine whether populations in specific settings and those determined to be at high risk for malaria may benefit from topical repellents. Research needs WHO encourages additional high-quality research to generate further evidence on: • the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences of topical repellents for populations determined to be “high-risk”, such as migrants, refugees, forest goers, military, those who sleep outdoors, etc.; • the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences of topical repellents for individuals who use repellents; • the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences of topical repellents for populations living in African settings; • the impact against P. vivax malaria (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences of topical repellents; and • contextual factors (e.g. acceptability, feasibility, resource use, cost-effectiveness, equity, values and preferences) related to the use of topical repellents.

    "content": "Insecticide-treated clothing (2019): Deployment of insecticide-treated clothing is not recommended for the prevention and control of malaria at the community level in areas with ongoing malaria transmission; however, insecticide-treated clothing may be beneficial as an intervention to provide personal protection against malaria in specific population groups. The GDG recommended against the deployment of insecticide-treated clothing due to the lack of evidence of an impact in the general population. In the absence of ITNs, there is some evidence that insecticide-treated clothing may reduce the risk of malaria infection in specific populations such as refugees and military personnel.\n\nBenefits and harms: Two RCTs were included in the systematic review [89]. Studies were conducted in specific populations in Colombia (military personnel) and Pakistan (Afghan refugees). The review reported that insecticide-treated clothing may have a protective effect against clinical malaria caused by P. falciparum (risk ratio: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.29–0.83; two studies; low-certainty evidence) and P. vivax (risk ratio: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.40–1.01; two studies; low-certainty evidence) in these populations in the absence of ITNs. No evidence was available on epidemiological effects in the general at-risk population. No undesirable effects were identified in the systematic review.\n\nJustification: The systematic review carried out in 2018 [89] provided low-certainty evidence that insecticide-treated clothing may have protective efficacy against P. falciparum and P. vivax cases, at least in certain specific populations (refugees, military personnel and others engaged in occupations that place them at high risk) and where ITNs are not in use. There was no evidence available on epidemiological effects in the general at-risk population.\n\nResearch needs: Determine the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences of insecticide-treated clothing in the general population. Identify approaches to enhance acceptability/desirability and increase uptake and adherence. Develop formulations that improve the durability of insecticidal efficacy.\n\nLow Certainty of the evidence: The systematic review assessed that the overall certainty of the evidence that insecticide-treated clothing in specific populations has an impact on malaria was low.\n\nResources and other considerations: Such clothing may be beneficial as a tool to provide personal protection against malaria in specific population groups (refugees, military personnel). Conditional recommendation for, Moderate certainty evidence.\n\nSpatial emanators (2025): Spatial emanators can be deployed for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission. The conditionality of the recommendation to deploy spatial repellents is based on the GDG’s judgement that the balance of desirable and undesirable effects probably favours deployment alongside ITNs or IRS, but considers that the systematic review found considerable heterogeneity in protective effect, largely explained by different levels of coverage achieved with the spatial repellent in each trial. The GDG therefore noted that effective protection of the population with spatial repellents depends on continuous high coverage in the target area, with duration of efficacy of the product and distribution model being the key determinants of feasibility and cost-effectiveness.\n\nIn deciding whether to deploy spatial emanators as a supplementary intervention, malaria programmes should: ensure that targeted coverage levels of interventions recommended for large-scale deployment (ITNs, IRS) are achieved and sustained; determine whether resources are adequate to cover the extra costs, especially given the residual efficacy of the specific spatial repellent product under consideration; generate additional information or conduct analyses with the aim of maximizing impact through targeted deployment (e.g., stratification of malaria risk, assessment of the characteristics of local vectors, such as local vector susceptibility to the active ingredient); note that only indoor use of spatial emanators has been assessed in the development of this recommendation, and therefore the recommendation only covers the indoor use of spatial emanators at this time; and note that WHO recommends selecting spatial emanators that are prequalified by WHO for deployment.\n\nPractical info and Implementation Costs for Spatial Emanators: Several resource requirements have been identified that may be useful to consider before deploying spatial emanators as part of a coordinated deployment strategy. The distribution of spatial emanators involves several logistical and financial considerations. Transportation and storage costs, especially in remote or rural areas, can have a significant impact on overall expenses. Customs and import fees may further increase costs when importing spatial emanators into malaria-endemic regions. Effective distribution relies on community-based delivery systems, such as health workers, local vendors or clinics, to ensure broad access and uptake. These systems require investment in both infrastructure and personnel to maintain a steady supply of products. In addition, implementation costs may include initial programme set-up expenses, such as training and education, as well as recurring operational costs for product replacement and redistribution. Because spatial emanators often require regular replacement, their long-term affordability may depend on sustained financial and programmatic support. Integrating spatial emanators with existing vector control tools, such as ITNs and IRS, may also incur costs related to programme coordination and outreach efforts. Beyond distribution and implementation, monitoring and evaluation will be essential to assess the effectiveness of spatial emanators in further reducing malaria transmission. Appropriate metrics of coverage will need to be determined. Community feedback systems should track user acceptance and adherence. Regular programme oversight will ensure that existing interventions (e.g., ITNs and IRS) remain effective and appropriately distributed/applied. Overall, the feasibility of spatial emanators will depend not only on the direct costs but also on sustained investment in monitoring, education and integration with existing malaria control activities. Any deployment strategy will need to account for product-specific manufacturing instructions, in particular the intended duration of efficacy and number of units required per unit area. Disposal and waste management should be considered.\n\nConclusion on Deployment: In deciding whether to deploy spatial emanators, control programmes should consider the available resources and ensure that spatial emanators are not deployed at the expense of ITN distribution or continued IRS programmes. Additional evidence is needed before WHO would be able to support a recommendation for the replacement of interventions for wide scale deployment with spatial emanators.\n\nEvidence to decision: Benefits and harms: This systematic review (Barker et al, unpublished evidence) investigated the effectiveness of spatial [repellents/emanators].",

    "content": "needed before WHO would be able to support a recommendation for the replacement of interventions for wide scale deployment with spatial emanators.\n\nEvidence to decision\nBenefits and harms This systematic review (Barker et al, unpublished evidence) investigated the effectiveness of spatial emanators in preventing malaria compared to placebo emanators or standard of care. The systematic review reported on six trials that evaluated the impact of spatial emanators used indoors on malaria. Two trials assessed coils, while four assessed passive emanators. One of these passive emanator trials evaluated passive emanators against Aedes-borne virus infections, but it was included for the outcomes of adverse effects, as the trial evaluated the same product as that used in the other trials.\n\nThe impact of spatial emanators was measured using passive emanators and mosquito coils. Malaria incidence was measured in four trials (three assessing passive emanators, one assessing coils) and showed an overall reduction of malaria incidence. This effect, however, depended on intervention coverage:\n• Overall, spatial emanators resulted in 472 fewer cases of malaria per 1000 people exposed to the intervention (903 fewer to 103 more cases; rate ratio: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.56–1.05; four trials; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to variability in intervention coverage, and study settings).\n• When community coverage of the intervention was ≥ 80%, there were 274 fewer cases of malaria per 1000 people exposed to spatial emanators (365 fewer to 158 fewer; rate ratio: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.56–0.81; two trials; high-certainty evidence). By contrast, when coverage was < 80%, there was little detectable difference from the control group (rate ratio: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.97–1.08; one trial; moderate-certainty evidence), suggesting that high levels of intervention coverage are essential.\n\nThe key conclusion was that spatial emanators are effective at reducing malaria cases, and the protective effect is dependent on high community coverage.\nParasite prevalence was assessed exclusively in trials that evaluated mosquito coils, with results as follows:\n• P. falciparum prevalence: Spatial emanators compared to control settings resulted in a slight reduction in parasite prevalence of 2.6 fewer cases per 1000 people (from 3 fewer cases to 1.7 fewer cases; OR: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.11–0.49; one trial; moderate-certainty evidence).\n• P. vivax prevalence: The same study found that there was a similar reduction in P. vivax prevalence of 2.7 fewer cases per 1000 people (from 3 fewer cases to 1.9 fewer cases; OR: 0.20; 95% CI: 0.09–0.44; one trial; moderate-certainty evidence).\n\nThese results highlight that spatial emanators (coils) can reduce parasite prevalence, particularly in areas with high coverage.\nWHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO)\n87 of 478\n\nWhile spatial emanators demonstrated benefits in terms of malaria reduction, potential harms and uncertainties were also considered. In terms of all-cause mortality, there is probably little to no difference in deaths when comparing spatial emanators to controls: four more deaths per 1000 people (from 2 fewer deaths to 40 more deaths; risk ratio = 2.35; 95% CI: 0.41–13.32; one trial; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to the low number of events and underpowered, small sample size for this outcome). The included trial reported deaths due to various causes (e.g. respiratory infections, drowning, unknown factors), but none were directly linked to spatial emanator exposure.\n\nFor adverse events, there is probably little to no difference between intervention and control groups in terms of adverse effects: 12 fewer adverse effects per 1000 people (from 68 fewer to 59 more; risk ratio = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.77–1.20; four trials; moderate-certainty evidence). No severe adverse effects were reported and associated with the intervention being evaluated. Common concerns related to long-term exposure include respiratory irritation from spatial emanators. Some of the adverse effects reported included breathing issues, headaches, allergic reactions and skin irritations; however, adverse effects were not systematically reported across all trials.\n\nPotential risks were identified through the systematic review, including:\n• Diversion of mosquitoes: Some trials reported concerns that non-users might experience increased mosquito-biting rates due to repelled mosquitoes being pushed into untreated areas.\n• Environmental concerns: Waste management and disposal of used emanators and coils require further evaluation, as improper disposal could contribute to insecticide resistance and/or environmental contamination.\n• Safety: As mosquito coils are burned, they may pose a fire hazard in homes. The health impact of regular use of mosquito coils may require further assessment due to increased exposure to the active ingredient and other components of the coil.\n• Misuse: Some users may rely on spatial emanators as a sole intervention while neglecting primary interventions; however, use of spatial emanators as a stand-alone intervention has not been assessed. In some countries, the registration of mosquito coils does not allow for indoor use.\n• Resistance: Continued use of spatial emanators may result in selection for insecticide resistance.\n\nIn summary, there was moderate- to high-certainty evidence supporting that spatial emanators reduce malaria incidence and Plasmodium prevalence, particularly with high coverage and when used in addition to ITNs. No major safety concerns were identified. Potential risks include mosquito diversion, environmental waste, fire hazards and insecticide resistance. The balance of effects probably favours the intervention.\n\nModerate Certainty of the evidence\nThe overall certainty of the evidence supporting the effectiveness of spatial emanators used indoors was rated as moderate, owing to numerous missing outcomes, and low certainty evidence for some of the more important outcomes. Some variability was also observed, depending on the outcome assessed. The certainty rating was based on the GRADE framework, considering factors such as risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision and publication bias. The primary reasons for downgrading the certainty of the evidence were observed heterogeneity in spatial emanator coverage levels (which likely influence effectiveness) between the studies. Furthermore, estimates were imprecise, with wide CIs for some key outcomes indicating considerable uncertainty. This was especially the case for the impact of spatial emanators on mortality and severe malaria, as these outcomes were rare and studies were not powered to detect a difference. The GDG also acknowledged that several research gaps remain.\n\nValues and preferences\nFor the outcomes included in the systematic review – mortality, prevalence of parasitaemia, incidence of malaria, incidence of severe disease, adverse effects – no specific research evidence was presented on the degree to which patients, their families and health care providers value these outcomes.\nWHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO)\n88 of 478\n\nNevertheless, outcomes such as reductions in malaria morbidity, mortality and severe disease prevention are likely to be valued. While there has been no research directly evaluating the degree to which",

    "content": "Nevertheless, outcomes such as reductions in malaria morbidity, mortality and severe disease prevention are likely to be valued. While there has been no research directly evaluating the degree to which individuals value specific outcomes, such as reduction of malaria incidence or parasite prevalence, indirect evidence suggests that there is high acceptability and perceived effectiveness among users. Communities may prioritize immediate, visible benefits (such as reduced mosquito bites) over longer term impacts on malaria transmission.\nResources The deployment of spatial emanators entails a range of financial and logistical considerations, including costs associated with production, distribution, implementation, monitoring and long-term sustainability. Insights from the deliberations of the GDG, along with findings from the systematic review, provide an overview of the economic and programmatic feasibility of these interventions. While spatial emanators offer an additional tool for malaria control, their financial sustainability and cost-effectiveness require further investigation.\nThe GDG assessed the resource requirements for spatial emanators as representing \"moderate costs\", although there is significant variability depending on the setting in which they are deployed. The financial burden of spatial emanator programmes comprises several key components. First, distribution costs involve transportation, supply chain management and import fees, which may fluctuate based on geographical location and regulatory requirements. Second, implementation costs are another major consideration, encompassing expenditures for training of personnel, operational expenses and product replacement. Finally, monitoring and evaluation costs include the assessment of intervention effectiveness and the development of community feedback systems to ensure continuous programme improvement. It is important to note that production costs were excluded from these considerations due to the variability of costs with the formulation of the active ingredient used and the scale of production by the manufacturer.\nGeneral affordability remains a central concern, particularly in low-income settings. Many malaria-endemic regions rely on subsidized interventions such as ITNs and IRS, raising questions about whether spatial emanators can be effectively integrated into existing control programme budgets. In such cases, securing external funding or integrating spatial emanators into broader vector control initiatives may be necessary to ensure equitable access and sustainability.\nDespite the potential of spatial emanators as an effective intervention, the systematic review was unable to include any formal cost-effectiveness studies. While preliminary economic models have been published, further investigation is needed to comprehensively assess the variability among emanators and coils, contextual factors, and impact in different transmission contexts, among other aspects.\nThe cost of spatial repellents must be considered in relation to alternative interventions. Mosquito coils, for example, remain a widely used low-cost alternative in many malaria-endemic regions. However, the cumulative costs of frequent replacement may surpass the cost of ITNs in the long term. These factors emphasize the importance of selecting interventions that offer both affordability and sustainability.\nA major source of uncertainty in assessing the costs of spatial emanators is related to product lifespan. The longevity of a spatial emanator directly influences its cost-effectiveness. Shorter duration products require frequent replacement, which increases both the financial costs and logistical burden. For example, a spatial emanator product requiring replacement every 28 days would cost more (in terms of both raw materials and operational deployment) than a longer duration alternative. Moreover, emanators with a lifespan of 12 months or more would reduce the need for frequent replacement, thereby lowering long-term costs and simplifying programme management. Contextual factors also play a crucial role in determining the financial and logistical feasibility of spatial repellent programmes. The number of units required per household, influenced by housing layout and density, can significantly impact costs, but may also make the intervention more economical where there are many people living within a single space.\nThere remain critical research gaps that must be addressed to refine cost-effectiveness estimates and inform policy decisions. To date, no studies have directly calculated the additive and synergistic effects of spatial emanators alone and in combination with ITNs and IRS in order to fully understand the potential cost-effectiveness under different scenarios. Until such research is conducted, it will be difficult to determine the relative value of spatial emanators within malaria control activities. In addition, more data are needed on optimal distribution models, particularly how costs scale in different geographical and economic contexts. Understanding the peak impact levels achievable through various coverage scenarios will help policy-makers to allocate resources effectively and maximize the benefits of spatial emanator deployment.\nIn conclusion, while the resource requirements for spatial emanators compared to no intervention were considered to result in a moderate increase in costs, their costs vary considerably depending on product choice, product lifespan, distribution logistics and the scale of implementation in different settings. Cost-effectiveness remains uncertain, with preliminary models indicating potential financial benefits when spatial emanators are deployed at high coverage levels. However, additional research is required to refine cost estimates, explore sustainable financing options and evaluate the long-term economic impact of integrating spatial emanators into national malaria strategies. Until these questions are fully addressed, large-scale policy recommendations on spatial emanators must be made with caution, ensuring that financial and operational feasibility is fully considered in the broader context of malaria prevention.\nCost-effectiveness\nNo specific study was commissioned to address this question. The GDG considered, however, that there were numerous factors that might influence cost-effectiveness, including the initial cost of the product, the duration of efficacy and required frequency of replacement of the product, the number of products required to effectively cover a household, and the integration of the deployment approach with existing programmatic work (inferring scalability). Cost-effectiveness may also be influenced by the incremental costs and synergies associated with complementary vector control implementation approaches within a community (e.g. IRS, ITNs), the duration of product efficacy and whether the intervention is used in high or low transmission settings.\nEquity The equity implications of spatial emanators were a key focus of the GDG discussions. The GDG considered that these emanators would potentially enhance malaria prevention by reaching populations underserved by standard interventions such as ITNs and IRS. However, their impact depends on",

    "content": "intervention is used in high or low transmission settings. Equity: The equity implications of spatial emanators were a key focus of the GDG discussions. The GDG considered that these emanators would potentially enhance malaria prevention by reaching populations underserved by standard interventions such as ITNs and IRS. However, their impact depends on accessibility, affordability and integration into national programmes. Gender and disability considerations are essential in malaria prevention. Cultural norms often limit women’s decision-making on ITN or IRS use, making it vital to ensure equal access to spatial emanators, as these devices are designed to protect everyone (including women and children) within the shared space. Furthermore, unlike ITNs, which require nightly use, and IRS, which relies on external implementation, spatial emanators may offer passive protection with fewer installation or application challenges, to persons with disabilities and/or mobility limitations. To enhance equity, spatial emanators may be incorporated into national malaria control strategies, ensuring that vulnerable populations, including pregnant women, children, older adults and individuals with limited mobility can benefit effectively without financial or logistical challenges. Spatial emanators may also offer protection to groups that are often missed by current prevention efforts, such as individuals who work outdoors, communities with housing that limits the effectiveness of IRS, and those in remote areas. Therefore, targeted distribution efforts may prioritize these underserved groups. However, equitable access goes beyond distribution alone; it also requires educational campaigns to be accessible and inclusive. To maximize uptake, awareness efforts must accommodate diverse needs by using formats such as Braille and sign language, as well as culturally and linguistically appropriate communication strategies that incorporate visual aids, audio materials and gender-sensitive messaging. Affordability potentially remains a barrier to accessibility should individuals have to cover some of the costs of the devices. While studies in Cambodia indicate high acceptance, many people reportedly would not replace ITNs with spatial emanators due to cost. The average willingness-to-pay was US$ 0.30 per unit, highlighting the need for subsidies, financing or inclusion in national programmes and thus programmatic roll-out. Free distribution would enhance equity by ensuring that cost does not become a barrier for low-income groups, whereas co-payment models risk excluding the most vulnerable populations. Furthermore, if funding is diverted from ITNs or IRS, overall malaria prevention coverage could be compromised; therefore, further studies are needed to better understand the additive and/or synergistic effects of spatial emanators when used either in combination with or instead of IRS and ITNs. This evidence will be important for ensuring data-driven/evidence-based decision-making processes. Potential risks associated with the use of spatial emanators include mosquito diversion, whereby individuals not covered by the intervention in a community or those at the outer limits of the treated area might suffer from an increase in mosquito biting. However, the Mali trial suggested that protection is extended even to non-users. In addition, variability in application rates could lead to inequitable protection, emphasizing the need for consistent implementation. In sum, spatial emanators have the potential to enhance equity in malaria prevention, particularly for vulnerable populations. However, achieving this requires careful planning to address economic and accessibility barriers, ensuring their effective integration into malaria control programmes. Acceptability: The acceptability of spatial emanators is influenced by various factors, including user perceptions, cultural compatibility, ease of use and perceived effectiveness. Findings from community-based studies and deliberations within the GDG suggest that while compliance rates can be high, acceptability remains context-specific, with certain concerns affecting adoption in different settings. Studies assessing user compliance with mosquito coils have demonstrated a generally high level of acceptance. For example, a study conducted in China reported that over 94% of participants consistently used mosquito coils, with more than 90% continuing to use ITNs alongside the coils [100]. Similarly, a study in Indonesia found that 98% of observed mosquito coils were fully burned by morning, suggesting that users did not extinguish them prematurely, reflecting high acceptance of the intervention [101]. These findings indicate that adherence tends to be strong when spatial emanators are perceived as effective and easy to use. However, acceptability is not universal and varies depending on user experiences and contextual factors. In a study conducted assessing passive emanators in Peru [102], a significant proportion of participating households requested the temporary or permanent removal of the intervention for various reasons (e.g. practical concerns such as ongoing construction, and doubts about effectiveness). These findings highlight the importance of individual and community-level preferences in determining the success of spatial emanator programmes. Perceived effectiveness, convenience and potential interference with daily life (including during deployment) appear to all play a role in influencing user acceptance. Cultural and behavioural factors are also critical in shaping the adoption of spatial emanators. For vector control strategies to be widely accepted, they must align with local traditions and practices. By ensuring that interventions do not require significant changes to daily routines, programmes can improve the likelihood of sustained use. From a policy perspective, health care and vector control experts generally recognize spatial emanators as a valuable complementary tool, particularly for providing protection in outdoor settings and during early evening hours when malaria transmission occurs. However, concerns remain regarding the long-term effects of exposure to certain repellent compounds, particularly pyrethroid-based products. Environmental sustainability is another consideration, as widespread adoption of spatial emanators could lead to increased chemical exposure and potential ecological consequences. Addressing these concerns through rigorous safety assessments and environmental impact evaluations will be critical to securing policy support and public trust. Several potential barriers to acceptance have also been identified. Some users expressed concerns about odour and smoke emissions from mosquito coils, which may deter consistent use. In addition, perceptions of effectiveness varied, with some participants believing that the intervention provided little or no protection against mosquitoes. The portability of emanators is another factor influencing acceptance, particularly among mobile populations who require flexible solutions that can be easily transported and used in different environments. Furthermore, adherence observed in controlled trial settings may not always reflect real-world behaviour, where usage patterns can decline over time due to changing priorities, inconvenience or loss of motivation.",

Furthermore, adherence observed in controlled trial settings may not always reflect real-world behaviour, where usage patterns can decline over time due to changing priorities, inconvenience or loss of motivation. In conclusion, spatial emanators are generally well accepted when they are integrated into daily routines and require minimal behaviour change. High acceptance is observed when users perceive a tangible benefit, but concerns remain regarding effectiveness, product replacement needs, health impacts and environmental impacts. To ensure long-term adoption, future research should explore strategies for optimizing cultural adaptation, improving perceived efficacy, and assessing sustained adherence in different communities. Understanding these factors will be essential for maximizing the potential of spatial emanators as a viable malaria prevention tool. Feasibility The feasibility of large-scale deployment of spatial emanators depends on multiple factors, including duration of efficacy, distribution and deployment logistics, coverage levels, and integration with existing malaria control strategies. Insights from the GDG deliberations and the systematic review highlight key challenges and considerations that must be addressed to ensure feasibility. One of the most significant logistical concerns is the duration of efficacy. Products with shorter durations (e.g. one month) may pose a challenge in terms of supply chain management and operational sustainability, including disposal. The frequent need for replacement increases logistical complexity, particularly in low-resource settings where distribution systems may already be stretched. However, the GDG recognized that new products with longer durations of efficacy are currently under development. Such longer lasting alternatives – ideally with a minimum duration of 12 months – would greatly enhance feasibility by reducing the burden of frequent replacement and ensuring more consistent protection. The distribution and deployment of spatial emanators present both opportunities and challenges. Unlike ITNs and IRS, spatial emanators can be used in a variety of settings, including both urban and rural areas and in humanitarian settings, without being limited by factors such as infrastructure availability and access to electricity. Spatial emanators could provide protection to everyone in the protected area, regardless of the time of day, the number of inhabitants and whether they are sleeping. In addition, some passive emanators can be set up independently by users, reducing reliance on trained personnel, in contrast to IRS, which requires technical expertise for application. In low-resource settings, successful deployment will likely depend on the integration of spatial emanators into national malaria strategies and existing community engagement programmes to ensure effective roll-out and sustained use. Coverage levels and operational considerations probably determine feasibility. Studies reported spatial emanator coverage using different metrics, making it difficult to systematically assess effectiveness. Some trials measured coverage based on the number of households receiving at least one emanator, while others used application rates calculated per square metre. These inconsistencies highlight the need for standardized reporting across studies to allow for better comparison and more realistic evaluation of real-world deployment. Given that spatial emanators function at a community level, coverage should also be measured at this scale, with appropriate targets set to reflect their broader impact. Possible coverage metrics include the proportion of households using spatial emanators according to manufacturer specifications and the proportion of individuals spending time in protected spaces. Another key consideration is the feasibility of mosquito coils, which are already used in some rural areas due to their lower infrastructure requirements. Their relative ease of deployment makes them a practical option in locations where other interventions, such as IRS, are unfeasible or unavailable. However, the need for frequent replacement remains a significant challenge, along with concerns about fire hazards and environmental waste. The long-term sustainability of coils is questionable, particularly in areas where more durable and efficient alternatives may be introduced. Despite the promising aspects of spatial emanators, there remain key research gaps that must be addressed to facilitate large-scale implementation. The overall feasibility of deployment and product replacement at scale is still uncertain, requiring further study to determine the sustainability of supply chains and programmatic distribution models. In addition, community-level feasibility – including long-term adherence, user acceptance and (potentially) willingness to pay (if spatial emanators are not integrated into national programmatic vector control) – needs to be explored to ensure that spatial emanators are both desirable and practical for end-users. Another unresolved question is how pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes respond to spatial emanators that use the same insecticide class. If resistance reduces effectiveness, this could have significant implications for the long-term viability of this intervention. In conclusion, the feasibility of spatial emanators is influenced by multiple factors, including product longevity, acceptability, affordability and integration into existing malaria control programmes. Longer lasting products would improve feasibility by reducing logistical challenges, while self-deployable options would enhance accessibility. However, frequent product replacement remains a challenge, particularly in resource-limited settings. Standardized metrics for assessing coverage are needed to ensure consistency across studies and facilitate accurate evaluations of impact. Future research should focus on addressing these gaps, particularly in terms of long-term adherence, cost-effectiveness and scalability. Careful consideration when integrating spatial emanators into national malaria strategies will be essential for maximizing their potential as a viable vector control tool. Justification The systematic review on spatial emanators identified notable heterogeneity in the efficacy of the intervention between studies, which was linked to several key factors. These included the community coverage of the intervention achieved in the trials, the density of the product used per covered space, whether it was a high or moderate transmission setting, and whether the intervention was a mosquito coil or a passive emanator. In addition, in one trial, there was heterogeneity in the amount of active ingredient measured on supposedly used products. The inconsistency of outcomes across trials therefore led the GDG to consider only a conditional recommendation for use. The intervention was deemed largely acceptable to end-users and feasible to deploy, although deployment efficiency may be",

The intervention was deemed largely acceptable to end-users and feasible to deploy, although deployment efficiency may be improved by harmonizing routine ITN deployments and community health efforts with deployment of the intervention. Equity was thought to probably increase with the use of spatial emanators, with some evidence that non-users within buffer zones also have increased protection against mosquito bites. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention, in its capacity to reduce disease burden, requires further investigation under different deployment models, with and without background interventions. Addressing the identified research gaps could potentially strengthen the recommendation, or, at minimum, broaden the recommended scope of spatial emanator use. Research needs: The following research needs or gaps were identified as valuable for further developing the scope of and/or refining the existing recommendation for the use of spatial emanators: \n• Quantify the impact of community coverage rates on the protective efficacy of spatial emanators, and determine whether all products require the same threshold coverage to achieve impact. \n• Evaluate spatial emanators as a stand-alone intervention and in combination with existing vector control interventions to quantify the additive and synergistic effects of different combinations of vector control tools. \n• Quantify the susceptibility of pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes to pyrethroid-based spatial emanators. \n• Quantify the potential for use and efficacy of spatial emanators outdoors, in peri-domestic settings, in mobile populations, and in structures that are not amenable to IRS application or installation of ITNs. \n• Quantify the efficacy of spatial emanators in emergency settings (including humanitarian emergencies). \n• Quantify the protective efficacy of spatial emanators in low versus moderate to high transmission settings. \n• Understand the protective effect of spatial emanators on additional end-points (e.g. case incidence, mortality attributed to malaria). \n• Quantify the risk of exposure to infectious bites for non-users due to diversion of host-seeking mosquitoes from protected areas. \n• Quantify the efficacy of spatial emanators against a range of vector species assemblages. \n• Quantify and qualify any long-term health effects associated with prolonged/consistent use of/exposure to spatial emanators deployed within confined spaces. \n• Quantify the spatial extent of the emanator’s protective effect. \n• Understand any effects on the health of individuals using spatial emanators, particularly in high-risk groups such as pregnant women, children and those with underlying health conditions. \n• Evaluate the effect of spatial emanators on the health of pets or domesticated animals if present in the home. \n• Determine the values and perceptions of different stakeholders, including malaria programme managers, community health workers, heads of households and women, with respect to spatial emanators. \nIn relation to resource requirements and cost-effectiveness, the following areas were identified as useful for informing future deliberations: \n• Determine the resource requirements associated with different distribution approaches and frequencies in different settings. \n• Compare the cost-effectiveness of products with different durations of efficacy (e.g. three months vs. 12 months). \n• Compare the cost-effectiveness of spatial emanators to that of other vector control interventions, with and without background core interventions. \n• Conduct modelling to determine the impact of heterogeneous coverage on equity of protection.\nEvidence to decision Justification: Only one observational study was identified by the systematic review and the certainty of the evidence was graded as very low [103]. The lack of data from RCTs, other trial designs or quasi-experimental studies has therefore hampered a comprehensive assessment of this intervention and the review concluded that it is unknown whether space spraying causes a reduction in the incidence of malaria. The anticipated desirable effects of space spraying are likely to be small, as the insecticide formulations used are short-lived. Anopheles mosquitoes are generally considered to be less susceptible to space spraying than Culex or Aedes. Space spraying is frequently applied when cases are at their peak, which is followed by a decline in cases, whether or not control measures are applied. Nevertheless, space spraying is often deployed in response to outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease. Due to the high visibility of this intervention, the decision to use this approach is usually made to demonstrate that the authorities are taking action in response to the outbreak. This practice should be strongly discouraged given the limited evidence of the intervention’s effectiveness, the high cost and the potential wastage of resources. The GDG therefore felt it necessary to develop a clear recommendation against space spraying for malaria control. Research needs: \n• Determine the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences of space spraying, particularly in emergency situations.\nConditional recommendation against, Very low certainty evidence: Space spraying (2019) is not recommended for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission; IRS or ITNs should be prioritized instead. The panel recommended against the deployment of space spraying to control malaria, given the lack of evidence of impact against malaria. Due to the short-lived nature of the insecticides used, space spraying is generally costly and wasteful of resources. Benefits and harms: The systematic review [103] included a single interrupted time series study from India in the meta-analysis, which was conducted more than 30 years ago. No impact on malaria cases per month was reported (step rate ratio: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.51–1.92; slope rate ratio: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.79–0.91). The panel judged that any anticipated desirable effect of space spraying is likely to be small, as the insecticide formulations used are short-lived. Anopheles mosquitoes are generally considered to be less susceptible to space spraying than Culex or Aedes. No undesirable effects were identified by systematic review. Very low Certainty of the evidence: The systematic review assessed that the overall certainty of the evidence that space spraying has an impact on malaria was very low. Resources and other considerations: Specialist technical equipment would be required to undertake space spraying. Combined with the human resource needs and the need for large amounts of insecticide, the costs are anticipated to be high, especially given the low residual effect of the chemicals used. Cost-effectiveness is considered to be limited for this intervention. If house screening is being considered as a means to prevent malaria, it is important to identify who the end-user will be and how",

    "content": "high, especially given the low residual effect of the chemicals used. Cost-effectiveness is considered to be limited for this intervention. Practical info: If house screening is being considered as a means to prevent malaria, it is important to identify who the end-user will be and how the intervention will be implemented, i.e. whether screening of houses will be a tool that the programme promotes for individuals or communities to implement at their own cost, or whether it will be undertaken as a programmatic initiative. Depending on the approach, the resources needed, feasibility, uptake and impact on equity may vary and would need to be considered. Screening of houses may be done post-construction or could be a standard feature for new homes. Intersectoral collaboration, for example, between health, housing and environmental sectors, is crucial in the implementation of house screening. It is also important to consider what standards and criteria, if any, need to be set for screening materials and designs, as they are for buildings. Screening of residential houses should be part of an IVM approach as promoted under the GVCR [16]. Deployment of interventions recommended for large-scale deployment (such as ITNs or IRS) should be maintained, and communities should be encouraged to continue using ITNs regularly or allow their houses to be sprayed, even if screening has been installed. In settings where national or local government authorities are not able to provide screening of residential houses as a public health strategy (e.g. due to feasibility/resource challenges), they should promote its use in affected communities. If house screening is deployed or adopted by communities to prevent malaria, post-distribution monitoring of the intervention is needed to assess material durability, usage and coverage. This information should guide how regularly screens require replacement or repair and provide information on the sustainability of the intervention. Evidence to decision: Conditional recommendation for , Low certainty evidence. House screening (2021): Screening of residential houses can be used for the prevention and control of malaria in children and adults in areas with ongoing malaria transmission. The GDG determined that a conditional recommendation should be given for house screening because of the low- to moderate-certainty evidence of an impact against malaria. Furthermore, programmes would need to consider a number of local contextual factors when considering screening of residential houses as a public health strategy, such as: how the intervention will be delivered and maintained; whether the structure and condition of the residential houses in the community allow for the installation of screening; the feasibility and resources needed for implementation, especially if deployed on a large scale. Programmes should note that this recommendation addresses the use of screening of windows, ceilings, doors and/or eave spaces, and does not cover other ways of blocking entry points into houses. Benefits and harms: The systematic review [104] included two cRCTs conducted in Ethiopia and Gambia that compared screened houses (without insecticide) to unscreened houses. There was low-certainty evidence that screening may reduce clinical malaria incidence caused by P. falciparum (rate ratio: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.18–0.82; one trial, low-certainty evidence) and parasite prevalence (risk ratio: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.60–1.17; one trial; low-certainty evidence). Anaemia was also reduced (risk ratio: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.42–0.89; one trial, moderate-certainty evidence). Screening may reduce the EIR, as both trials showed lower estimates in the intervention arm. The systematic review noted from a pooled analysis of the two studies that individuals living in screened houses (covered eaves, windows and doors) were 16% less likely to sleep under a mosquito net (risk ratio: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.65–1.09; two trials, 203 participants). However, the results from the two studies were discrepant: in Ethiopia, the study [105] found no difference in ITN use in screened or unscreened homes, while the study [106] in Gambia found that reported use of ITNs was lower in houses with screened ceilings (26%, 70/272) than in control houses (35%, 57/162; p=0.04). In the Gambian study, the number of mosquitoes in the house were reduced, which could have resulted in fewer participants feeling the need to use a net to prevent biting. None of the other pre-specified outcomes (all-cause mortality; other disease incidence; adverse effects; unintended effects other than bed net usage) were reported in the included studies. Based on the evidence presented in the review, the GDG judged that in some settings there may be potential undesirable effects associated with house screening; however, all of the potential effects identified by the GDG were judged to be small: Inhabitants of screened houses may stop or reduce their use of other effective interventions such as ITNs, especially if house screening is perceived to greatly reduce mosquito entry and/or be sufficient alone to protect against malaria. The decline or discontinuation in the use of interventions is likely not limited to those deployed with house screening; if any intervention that is deployed in conjunction with another is perceived to be sufficiently effective alone, use of the co-deployed intervention may decline. Screening of available entry points for mosquitoes into the house may result in reduced airflow and ventilation, and increased indoor temperatures compared to unscreened openings. While the GDG remarked that, as a result, occupants may open doors and windows (thereby negating the benefit of screening and, in turn, increasing the risk of mosquito exposure), in Côte d’Ivoire this was not the case. Households with screened openings did not differ from those with no screening in terms of opening and closing windows [107]. Reduced airflow and ventilation has been shown to result in increased respiratory problems and infections [108] and increased indoor air pollution, which negatively affects human health [109][110][111]. However, if household inhabitants routinely close entry points at night, such as windows, screening these openings would allow for increased airflow and ventilation compared to when they are closed, thereby reducing indoor temperatures as shown in Gambia [112][113]. Low Certainty of the evidence: The systematic review assessed that the overall certainty of the evidence that house screening has an impact on malaria was low. Values and preferences: No research was identified regarding preferences and values. The GDG judged that there was probably no important uncertainty or variability. Resources: Resources needed for the screening of houses may depend on whether the intervention is deployed by the programme or implemented by the community. The list below, compiled by the GDG, itemizes resources that should be considered. Note that this list does not include resource needs for product selection or assessment of impact of the intervention.

Depending on how the intervention is deployed, the effect on equity may vary. For example, if individuals are encouraged to screen houses themselves, equity may be reduced. If the intervention is deployed at the programme level, it may be increased. The impact on equity may also depend on house structure and conditions, as some features may not allow for screening. Acceptability: The studies included in the systematic review used in-depth interviews and focus group discussions to assess community acceptance of the intervention. In both studies, participants reported that the intervention reduced the number of indoor mosquitoes and house flies. Most participants in both trials chose to have screening after the duration of the trial. Additionally, participants in the study from the Republic of the Gambia reported a reduction in entry of other animals, such as bats, cockroaches, earwigs, geckos, mice, rats, snakes, and toads. In both trials, participants expressed concern that screening would be damaged by domestic animals and children, or that it would become dirty. In the Ethiopian study, some participants reported that they made further efforts to reduce mosquito entry after screening installation, such as filling in wall openings with mud. Feasibility: National programmes considering the adoption of screening of residential houses as a public health strategy should assess: \n• whether the structure and condition of the residential houses in the community allow for the installation of screening and are accessible;\n• whether adequate resources are available, particularly if houses require screening to be made bespoke and if there is a need to renovate some houses to enable screening;\n• the level of community buy-in (acceptability and/or willingness to implement the intervention);\n• the feasibility of implementation if it is on a large scale, including the impact on resource use and potential changes in cost-effectiveness of the programme, and also taking into account the values, preferences and cultural norms of the main stakeholders; and\n• how the intervention will be delivered and maintained. Justification: The systematic review [104] identified only two eligible published studies assessing the impact of housing modifications on malaria epidemiological outcomes conducted in Ethiopia and Gambia. Both studies investigated the impact of house screening (screening of windows, ceilings, doors and/or eaves) with untreated materials against malaria. The authors concluded that screening may reduce clinical malaria incidence, parasite prevalence, prevalence of anaemia and EIR. In the trials included in the systematic review, research teams deployed screening at the community level and, as a result, there is currently no evidence as to the benefits and harms of individuals or communities deploying screens themselves. The review identified several studies that were yet to be published on the efficacy of insecticide-treated screening, eave tubes or other forms of housing modifications, but the data were not available at the time for inclusion in the review. Given that only two trials were included in the review, a number of potential effect modifiers could not be examined, and the generalizability of the findings was limited. The panel concluded that untreated screening of residential houses may prevent malaria and reduce malaria transmission, and that these desirable effects would outweigh the undesirable effects. However, in translating this evidence into a recommendation strength, the GDG concluded that the recommendation should be conditional due to the low- to moderate-certainty evidence and based on a number of contextual factors. The panel judged that policy-makers considering house screening should assess the feasibility, acceptability, impact on equity and resources needed for screening houses in their contexts in order to determine whether such an intervention would be appropriate for their setting. Research needs: WHO encourages funding of high-quality research on the impact of interventions under the broad category of “housing modifications” to further inform the development of specific WHO recommendations. Results from four trials awaiting publication are likely to enrich the current evidence base on housing modifications for preventing malaria and controlling malaria transmission. Publication of these studies is strongly encouraged. A number of specific evidence gaps and associated requirements were identified: \n• Further evidence is needed on the impact (incidence of malaria [infection or clinical] and/or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences of house screening, as well as other housing modification interventions deployed alone or in combination.\n• Epidemiological evidence is required on the efficacy against malaria of the same intervention implemented in different settings (where vector species may differ).\n• Evidence is needed on contextual factors (i.e. acceptability, feasibility, resource use, cost-effectiveness, equity, values and preferences) related to house screening, as well as other housing modification interventions.\n• Determine the resource needs, costs and cost-effectiveness of various deployment options for house screening (at the programme, community and individual level).\n• Develop deployment mechanisms and foster community buy-in for house screening and other housing modification interventions.",

    "content": "The text outlines necessary research and evaluation priorities for various vector control interventions, often focusing on assessing impact (incidence or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential unintended consequences.\n\nFor areas with mosquito populations resistant to insecticides other than pyrethroids, further investigation is needed. For interventions combining Insecticide-Treated Nets (ITNs) and Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS): Evidence is needed on the impact (incidence or prevalence of malaria infection) and potential harms/unintended consequences of combining ITNs with IRS versus IRS alone, and the consequences of switching from ITNs to IRS versus co-deployment of the two interventions. Acceptability of combining IRS and ITNs among householders and communities must be determined, and evaluation of new tools for monitoring the quality of IRS and ITN interventions is needed.\n\nRegarding Larviciding, further evidence is needed on its impact and potential harms/unintended consequences. New technologies for identifying aquatic habitats should also be evaluated. For Larval habitat manipulation/modification, research must determine the impact and potential harms of the different interventions. Epidemiological evidence is required on the efficacy of the same intervention across different settings (where vector species may differ). Detailed descriptions of deployed interventions, larval habitat types, and targeted vector species are needed. The impact of the intervention on the water conditions of the larval habitats should be assessed, i.e., properties of the habitat that the intervention aims to modify such as water flow, volume, sunlight penetration, salinity, or other physical conditions.\n\nFor Larvivorous fish, determining the impact and potential harms/unintended consequences of their use is required.\n\nFor Topical repellents, further evidence is sought on impact and harms for high-risk groups (such as migrants, refugees, forest goers, military, those who sleep outdoors, etc.), for individuals who use repellents, and for populations living in African settings. Specific evidence is also needed against P. vivax malaria. Contextual factors like acceptability, feasibility, resource use, cost-effectiveness, equity, values, and preferences related to the use of topical repellents must be generated.\n\nFor Insecticide-treated clothing, research must determine the impact and potential harms/unintended consequences in the general population, identify approaches to enhance acceptability/desirability and increase uptake and adherence, and develop formulations that improve the durability of insecticidal efficacy.\n\nFor Spatial emanators, priorities include quantifying the impact of community coverage rates on protective efficacy (and determining threshold coverage needs), evaluating them as stand-alone interventions and in combination with existing vector control tools to quantify additive and synergistic effects, and quantifying the susceptibility of pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes to pyrethroid-based emanators. Research should also quantify potential for use and efficacy outdoors, in peri-domestic settings, in mobile populations, in structures that are not amenable to IRS application or installation of ITNs, in emergency settings (including humanitarian emergencies), and across low versus moderate-to-high transmission settings. Understanding the protective effect on additional end-points (e.g., case incidence, mortality attributed to malaria) and quantifying the risk of exposure to infectious bites for non-users (due to diversion of host-seeking mosquitoes from protected areas) is crucial. Efficacy against a range of vector species assemblages needs quantification, along with potential long-term health effects associated with prolonged/consistent use/exposure, particularly in high-risk groups (pregnant women, children, and those with underlying health conditions). Evaluation of the effect on the health of pets or domesticated animals is also required. Furthermore, determining stakeholder values and perceptions, resource requirements for different distribution approaches, comparing the cost-effectiveness of products with different durations, and comparison with other vector control interventions (with and without background core interventions) are necessary. Modelling should be conducted to determine the impact of heterogeneous coverage on equity of protection.\n\nRepellents in general require epidemiological and/or entomological evidence on whether they cause diversion of malaria mosquitoes from a treated area to a neighboring untreated area.\n\nFor Space spraying, the impact and potential harms/unintended consequences must be determined, particularly in emergency situations.\n\nFor House modifications, further evidence is needed on the impact and harms/unintended consequences of house screening and other modifications deployed alone or in combination. Epidemiological evidence on efficacy across different settings is required. Resources needs, costs, and cost-effectiveness of various deployment options for house screening must be determined. Developing deployment mechanisms and fostering community buy-in for house screening and other housing modification interventions are also key. The final listed topic is Insecticide resistance management.",

Chemoprevention uses full therapeutic courses of antimalarial medicines at prescheduled times, irrespective of infection status, to treat existing infections and prevent new infections and thus reduce malaria in people living in endemic areas. Chemoprophylaxis usually involves administration of sub-therapeutic doses of antimalarials to prevent new infections and is primarily used by non-immune people travelling to malaria endemic areas. Chemoprophylaxis is not addressed in detail in the current guidelines beyond the short description in this section.\nCurrent WHO recommendations for chemoprevention include the intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp), perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC), previously known as intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi), seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), intermittent preventive treatment in school-aged children (IPTsc), post-discharge malaria chemoprevention (PDMC) and mass drug administration (MDA) for malaria burden and transmission reduction, and mass relapse prevention. Each of these recommendations reflects the biological plausibility that a treatment course of an effective antimalarial will clear any existing, and prevent new, malaria infections. This underlying principle can inform the adaptation of recommendations to maximize impact in different settings.\nThe updated chemoprevention recommendations reflect the paradigm shift, outlined in the introduction, to provide greater flexibility to NMPs to adapt control strategies to suit their settings. Standard processes have been used to develop evidence-based recommendations which are not unduly restrictive. We no longer specify strict age groups, transmission intensity thresholds, numbers of doses or cycles, or specific drugs. The effectiveness of a chemoprevention programme will be influenced by a host of contextual and other factors (e.g. intensity of malaria transmission, extent of seasonal variation in transmission, the age group targeted by the chemoprevention programme, the preventive efficacy of the drugs used, the frequency of dosing, duration of protection of each treatment course, availability of drugs, coverage achieved, adherence to the recommended regimen) and by the mix of interventions being deployed in each setting. NMPs are therefore encouraged to consider local data to determine how best to tailor chemoprevention strategies to local needs and determine which age groups should be prioritized where, for how long, how frequently, and with which drugs. Subnational tailoring is increasingly needed, for example to recognize the variation in duration of the transmission season even within a country, meaning that 3, 4, 5 or more cycles of SMC may be warranted in different subnational areas.\nTo support decision making, each chemoprevention recommendation is accompanied by a summary of available research evidence, an explanation of how this was used to inform the recommendation and practical information regarding key considerations for implementation.\nProtection for travellers to malaria-endemic areas\nThe primary target for these guidelines is people living in endemic areas and no formal recommendations regarding preventive chemotherapy are currently included for non-immune people travelling to malaria endemic regions. People growing up in endemic countries will increasingly be non-immune as malaria control improves. However, epidemiological changes will be heterogeneous and future guidelines will need to consider the use of chemoprophylaxis among people growing up in areas without malaria (e.g. some urban settings) who then travel within their own country to places where malaria is endemic (e.g. many rural settings). The potential of chemoprophylaxis for people at risk of occupational exposure to malaria (e.g. farmers, miners) also warrants consideration. Readers interested in the use of antimalarial agents to prevent malaria in people travelling from non-endemic settings to areas of malaria transmission are directed to the WHO International travel and health guidance [2].\nIn summary, travellers should start chemoprophylaxis before entering an endemic area, to assess tolerability and, for slowly eliminated drugs, to build up therapeutic concentrations. Malaria may be prevented by taking drugs that inhibit liver-stage (pre-erythrocytic) development (causal prophylaxis) or drugs that kill asexual blood stages (suppressive prophylaxis). Causal prophylactics (atovaquone + proguanil) can be stopped soon after leaving an endemic area, whereas suppressive prophylactics must be taken for at least 4 weeks after leaving the area in order to eliminate asexual parasites emerging from the liver weeks after exposure.\n4.2.1 Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp)\nIntermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) is the administration of a treatment course of an antimalarial medicine at predetermined intervals, regardless of whether the pregnant woman is infected with malaria.

    "content": "4.2.1 Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp). Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) is the administration of a treatment course of an antimalarial medicine at predetermined intervals, regardless of whether the pregnant woman is infected with malaria. Malaria infection during pregnancy poses substantial risks not only to the mother, but also to her fetus and the newborn. This updated IPTp recommendation builds on evidence from seven trials that informed the previous recommendation (2012) for the use of at least three doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) for IPTp during antenatal care (ANC) visits in the second and third trimester of the first and second pregnancies to improve birth outcomes. The initial evidence also demonstrated that IPTp reduced maternal anaemia and infection with malaria. This update assessed the potential effects of gravidity, malaria transmission intensity, and SP resistance on the effectiveness of IPTp-SP, and the recommendation has been revised accordingly. The evidence showed that, compared to two doses, three or more doses of IPTp-SP increased mean birthweight by 56g (95% CI: 29–83g higher; high-certainty evidence); reduced the number of low birthweight infants (relative risk: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.69–0.94; high-certainty evidence); reduced placental parasitaemia (relative risk: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.38–0.68; high-certainty evidence); and probably reduced maternal parasitaemia (relative risk: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.52–0.89; moderate-certainty evidence). Practical info: Antimalarial medicine. WHO recommends that the medicines used for IPTp be different from those used as first-line malaria treatment. SP has been widely used for chemoprevention during pregnancy and has been shown to be efficacious, safe, well tolerated, available and inexpensive. A drug regimen that can be administered as a directly observed single dose, such as SP, is preferable to a multi-day regimen. The Guideline Development Group did not formally consider alternative drug regimens to SP for IPTp, or their associated costs. However, recent studies of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAP) in areas of high SP resistance have shown that, although superior to SP in reducing malaria during pregnancy, the use of DHAP did not translate into better pregnancy outcomes; SP was associated with better fetal growth, resulting in higher mean birthweights in all gravidae (Gutman et al unpublished evidence (a)). Transmission. In areas of moderate to high P. falciparum transmission, IPTp-SP should be given to all pregnant women. Whether there continues to be a role for IPTp in areas where malaria transmission has fallen to low levels is uncertain. Strong recommendation for Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (2022), Moderate certainty evidence. In malaria-endemic areas, pregnant women of all gravidities should be given antimalarial medicine at predetermined intervals to reduce disease burden in pregnancy and adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) has been widely used for malaria chemoprevention during pregnancy and remains effective in improving key pregnancy outcomes. IPTp-SP should start as early as possible in the second trimester and not before week 13 of pregnancy. Doses should be given at least one month apart, with the objective of ensuring that at least three doses are received. Antenatal care (ANC) contacts remain an important platform for delivering IPTp. Where inequities in ANC service and reach exist, other delivery methods (such as the use of community health workers) may be explored, ensuring that ANC attendance is maintained and underlying inequities in ANC delivery are addressed. IPTp is generally highly cost-effective, widely accepted, feasible for delivery and justified by a large body of evidence generated over several decades. It is evidence that even in areas with PfPR2-10 < 3%, IPTp-SP reduces maternal anaemia and may reduce low birthweight, as well as maternal and placental infection (Gutman et al unpublished evidence (a)). Some of these effects may not be due to the effects of IPTp-SP on malaria. There is currently insufficient data to define the level of transmission below which IPTp-SP may cease to be cost-effective. Challenges of IPTp reintroduction after withdrawal caution against discontinuing IPTp-SP following a recent reduction in malaria transmission. Pregnancy. IPTp improves a wide range of outcomes in women in their first and second pregnancies, including maternal and placental infection, maternal anaemia and low birthweight (Gutman et al unpublished evidence (a)). There is now evidence that IPTp also reduces maternal infection in third or subsequent pregnancies, but there are currently too few trials to evaluate effects on other outcomes in these women (Gutman et al unpublished evidence (a)). Administering IPTp to all pregnant women regardless of number of pregnancies facilitates ease of IPTp implementation for health workers. Dosage. IPTp-SP should ideally be administered as directly observed therapy (DOT) with three tablets of SP (each tablet containing 500 mg/25 mg SP), for the total required dosage of 1500 mg/75 mg SP. Schedule. IPTp-SP should not be given before week 13 of pregnancy due to an increased risk of fetal malformation. IPTp-SP should start in the second trimester and doses should be given at each scheduled ANC contact until the time of delivery, provided that doses are at least one month apart. At least three doses of IPTp-SP should be received during pregnancy. Delivery. ANC contacts remain an important platform for delivering IPTp, and so inequities in ANC service and reach should be addressed. Research on alternative approaches to IPTp delivery (e.g. through community health workers) may identify opportunities to increase coverage, while ensuring that ANC attendance is maintained. This may be useful for supporting IPTp delivery while measures to address ANC inequities are implemented. Consideration should be given to contextual factors such as the values and preferences of end-users, costs, coverage and sustainability of alternative delivery platforms. Drug resistance. IPTp-SP appears to select for antifolate resistance mutations associated with low to moderate increases in drug resistance. However, there is no convincing evidence of selection favouring key mutations, such as dhpsA581G, which is associated with the loss of IPTp-SP efficacy (Plowe unpublished evidence). There is also insufficient evidence to withhold IPTp-SP in areas where the prevalence of dhpsA581G exceeds a threshold of 10% (Plowe unpublished evidence). Although the ability of IPTp-SP to clear existing infections and prevent new ones is compromised in areas of high to very high resistance, the intervention still reduces low birthweight and maternal anaemia. Consequently, IPTp-SP should continue to be used in areas of high SP resistance until more effective alternatives for malaria chemoprevention are found. Contraindications. IPTp is not recommended for pregnant women before week 13 of pregnancy, or those with severe acute illness, or who are unable to take oral medication, or women who during the last 30 days received a dose of any of the drugs being used for IPTp, or those.",

    "content": "effective alternatives for malaria chemoprevention are found.\nContraindications\nIPTp is not recommended for pregnant women before week 13 of pregnancy, or those with severe acute illness, or who are unable to take oral medication, or women who during the last 30 days received a dose of any of the drugs being used for IPTp, or those allergic to any of the components of SP. IPTp-SP should not be given to individuals receiving a sulfa-based medicine as treatment or prophylaxis, including co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole) for HIV. High doses of folic acid (daily dose ≥ 5 mg) have been shown to counteract the efficacy of SP as an antimalarial, and only low-dose formulations (i.e. 0.4 mg daily) should be co-administered with SP.\nOther considerations\nInformation about IPTp should be fully accessible to pregnant women. As with all health interventions, consent should be obtained from the pregnant woman prior to administering IPTp.\nEvidence to decision\nBenefits and harms In the mother\n• Anaemia: IPTp-SP may reduce maternal anaemia (risk ratio: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.87–0.93; low-certainty evidence) and increase maternal haemoglobin (mean difference: 0.19 g/dL higher; 95% CI: 0.15–0.22 g/dL higher; low-certainty evidence) for each dose of SP in all gravidae. The effect is lower but remains significant in the highest SP resistance areas1 (relative risk reduction: 8.2%; 95% CI: 3–13%). IPTp-SP also reduced maternal anaemia in areas with PfPR2-10 < 3% (risk ratio: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.85–0.97).\n• Placental and maternal malaria infection at delivery: IPTp-SP probably reduces placental infection (risk ratio: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.74–0.84; moderate-certainty evidence) and maternal malaria infection at delivery (risk ratio: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.75–0.85; moderate-certainty evidence) for each dose of SP in all gravidae, compared to no IPTp-SP. Overall, IPTp-SP was associated with a 20% reduction (95% CI: 16–24%) in placental or maternal malaria at delivery compared to no IPTp-SP. The effect was greater in first and second pregnancies (24%; 95% CI: 19–29%) than in third or subsequent pregnancies (17%; 95% CI: 13–20%). There was a trend towards reduced efficacy with increased resistance, with a relative risk of 28% (95% CI: 20–36%) in the lowest resistance stratum and 22% (95% CI: 14–29%), 8% (95% CI: 0–7%) and -5% (95% CI: -16–5%) in the moderate, high and very high resistance strata, respectively. The effect of IPTp-SP in areas with PfPR2-10 < 3% was variable (risk ratio for maternal malaria: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.53–1.01; and for placental malaria: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.68–1.15).\n• Adverse events: IPTp-SP had a pooled prevalence of serious adverse events of 3.84% (95% CI: 2.20–5.88%) and a pooled prevalence of adverse events of 14.3% (95% CI: 4.9–27.5%). In two trials comparing IPTp-SP to placebo or case management, the pooled risk ratio showed that IPTp-SP may reduce maternal adverse events (risk ratio: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.30–1.01; moderate-certainty evidence). Skin reactions were rarely reported, with a pooled prevalence of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2–0.7%) among all women who took IPTp-SP and with no significant increase in the two trials comparing IPTp-SP to placebo or case management (pooled risk ratio: 1.24; 95% CI: 0.34–4.58).\n• Maternal death: The effect of IPTp-SP on maternal death is poorly documented. It is possible that IPTp-SP results in little to no difference in maternal death (risk ratio: 1.17; 95% CI: 0.49–2.80; low-certainty evidence).\nNone of the studies in the systematic review reported on malaria infection, severe malaria, or maternal hospitalization.\nIn the fetus and infant\n• Birthweight: IPTp-SP probably reduces low birthweight for each dose of SP compared to no IPTp-SP (risk ratio: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.71–0.78; low-certainty evidence) for all gravidae. The point estimate is slightly higher in first and second pregnancies (26%; 95% CI: 21–31%) than in third or subsequent pregnancies (21%; 95% CI: 16–26%). Compared to no IPTp-SP, each dose of IPTp-SP probably increases mean birthweight for babies born to women of all gravidae (mean difference: 57 g higher; 95% CI: 44–69 g; moderate-certainty evidence). IPTp-SP was associated with a mean increase in birthweight of 67 g (95% CI: 50–85 g) in babies born to women in their first and second pregnancies and 43 g (95% CI: 26–60 g) in third or subsequent pregnancies. The relative risk reduction in low birthweight decreased with increasing SP resistance, remaining significant in high-resistance areas (relative risk reduction: 23%; 95% CI: 16–29%), but becoming non-significant in the highest SP resistance areas (relative risk reduction: 16%; 95% CI: -4–32%). Mean difference in birthweight was 65 g (95% CI: 44–87 g), 66 g (95% CI: 45–88 g) and 46 g (95% CI: 27–66 g) in the lowest, middle and high SP resistance areas, respectively. There was a non-significant mean difference of 11 g (95% CI: -9–32 g) in the highest resistance areas.\n• Adverse pregnancy outcomes: Each dose of IPTp-SP may reduce preterm delivery compared to no IPTp-SP (risk ratio: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.71–0.81; very low-certainty evidence). However, the evaluation of preterm delivery and number of SP doses is complicated because prematurity inherently reduces the opportunity to receive more SP doses. It is uncertain whether IPTp-SP reduces stillbirths and spontaneous abortions compared to no IPTp-SP (risk ratio: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.59–0.78; very low-certainty evidence).\nNone of the studies in the systematic review reported on malaria infection, anaemia, severe malaria, hospital admissions, or death.\nMore information on the evidence can be found in the systematic review (Gutman et al unpublished evidence (a)).\n1 Resistance was defined as low (Ala437Gly < 75% in Central/West Africa or Lys540Glu < 40% in Eastern/Southern Africa), medium (Ala437Gly ≥ 75% in Central/West Africa or Lys540Glu 40–60% and Ala581Gly < 5% in Eastern/Southern Africa), high (Lys540Glu ≥ 60% and Ala581Gly < 5% in Eastern/Southern Africa) and very high (Lys540Glu ≥ 60% and dhps Ala581Gly ≥ 5% in Eastern/Southern Africa).\nModerate Certainty of the evidence\nThe certainty of evidence across the outcomes ranged from very low to moderate, with a number of the outcomes deemed important by the GDG classed as moderate-certainty evidence. The GDG noted sustained impact of IPTp-SP across all transmission and resistance settings. Consequently, the overall certainty of evidence for the outcomes of interest was considered moderate by the GDG. This reflects the large number of observational studies contributing useful information to these updated guidelines, building on the initial more robust data from randomized controlled trials.\nMore information on the certainty of evidence assessments can be found in the ‘research evidence’ tab associated with this recommendation online or in the annex of the pdf version.\nValues and preferences\nPreferences and values of the target population were determined by:\n• consultation with civil society, which indicated that chemoprevention to prevent malaria disease in pregnant women was seen as a priority in endemic areas (CS4ME unpublished evidence);\n• a synthesis of contextual factors from studies of IPTp-SP, although these lacked data on how IPTp-SP was valued (Rodriguez et al unpublished evidence).",

    "content": "Consultation with civil society, which indicated that chemoprevention to prevent malaria disease in pregnant women was seen as a priority in endemic areas (CS4ME unpublished evidence); a synthesis of contextual factors from studies of IPTp-SP, although these lacked data on how IPTp-SP was valued (Rodriguez et al unpublished evidence). The GDG vote on values and preferences was equally split between “probably no important uncertainty or variability” and “possibly important uncertainty or variability” in how the outcomes of IPTp are valued across contexts. The vote was repeated and remained split. Those who voted for the latter felt that IPTp may be valued differently depending on the transmission and resistance context. The consensus of the GDG was not to say that values and preferences vary but rather to highlight the two positions. More information can be found in the civil society consultation report (CS4ME unpublished evidence). Resources An individually randomized, placebo-controlled trial in a moderately intense transmission setting in Mozambique found IPTp-SP to be a highly cost-effective intervention [115]. Based on data from 2007, the financial cost of delivering two doses of IPTp-SP through ANC was about US$ 435.79 per 1000 pregnant women. Delivering two doses of IPTp-SP to 1000 pregnant women resulted in a total health system cost saving of US$ 422.74, 43% of which was attributed to reduced hospital admissions. Consequently, the net intervention cost was US$ 13.17 per 1000 pregnant women. IPTp-SP led to substantial household cost savings for women seen in the outpatient department (US$ 33.89 in direct costs; 95% CI: 6.10–77.20; and US$ 83.79 in indirect costs; 95% CI: 29.60–148.30). However, it did not lead to statistically significant household cost savings for women who required admission for malaria (US$ 8.20 in direct costs; 95% CI: -42.80–55.80; and US$ 11.44 in indirect costs; 95% CI: -20.50–42.70). Delivering IPTp-SP to 1000 pregnant women was expected to avert 18.9 (95% CI: 4.4–33.8) neonatal deaths, or 555.2 (95% CI: 129.0–992.0) disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). This study determined threshold values of some variables beyond which IPTp-SP was no longer cost-effective. These were when ANC attendance is lower than 37.5%, the protective efficacy of IPTp-SP against maternal infection is lower than 15%, maternal clinical malaria incidence is lower than 0.15 person-year at risk, or the maternal case fatality ratio is lower than 0.15%. Based on the data from Mozambique, the intervention costs of delivering two doses of IPTp-SP were US$ 41.46 per DALY averted versus US$ 7.28 per DALY averted for three doses [115][116]. The cost of one dose of IPTp-SP was reported to be between US$ 0.63 and US$ 0.79 [116][117]. The GDG considered that there were negligible costs and savings associated with implementing IPTp-SP and the certainty of the evidence on the resources required was moderate. The GDG determined that IPTp is probably cost-effective compared to no intervention. Justification This recommendation was developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework [127]. Sources of information Recommendation development was informed by a systematic review (Gutman et al unpublished evidence (a)) and a report summarizing evidence from published studies on contextual factors related to IPTp implementation (Rodriguez et al unpublished evidence), including cost-effectiveness, feasibility, equity, values and acceptability. These sources of information were supplemented by a cross-cutting review on chemoprevention and drug resistance (Plowe unpublished evidence), a civil society consultation report on chemoprevention (CS4ME unpublished evidence) and contributions from the GDG membership, which. More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Rodriguez et al unpublished evidence). Equity Age, marital status, religion, and living in a rural area were found to influence the uptake of IPTp-SP in 13 studies. Women under 20 years old were generally the least likely to receive three doses of IPTp-SP, with those between 25 and 34 most likely to receive IPTp-SP. Socioeconomic considerations including education level, employment status and wealth index affected uptake of IPTp. Higher uptake was associated with being married and higher education, and some studies found a strong association between employment status and IPTp-SP uptake. Many studies reported that women in the “middle” to “richest” wealth index had higher uptake of IPTp-SP compared to those in the “poorest” to “poorer” wealth categories, including receipt of at least three doses of IPTp-SP. Rural residence was inconsistently associated with improved IPTp-SP uptake. Studies conducted in Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, and Sierra Leone reported that women who lived in rural areas were more likely to take the recommended doses of IPTp-SP, while studies in Ghana, Malawi and Nigeria reported that urban residence was associated with higher IPTp-SP uptake compared to rural residence. Living more than 5 km from a health facility was also associated with poorer uptake of IPTp-SP. The GDG considered that the health equity of IPTp varies depending on contextual factors, especially those influencing access to ANC services. IPTp programmes that address inequities will likely improve coverage of IPTp and improve pregnancy outcomes. More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Rodriguez et al unpublished evidence). Acceptability IPTp has been widely accepted by pregnant women. Greater knowledge about IPTp has been shown to increase acceptance and uptake of the intervention. ANC attendance is a main driver influencing patient acceptance of IPTp-SP. Numerous studies have reported increased uptake of IPTp-SP with early initiation of education and counselling sessions at ANC, specifically during the first trimester, as well as frequent ANC contacts. In general, women who were concerned about the side effects of SP were less likely to take the recommended number of doses of IPTp-SP. The GDG considered IPTp to probably be acceptable to key stakeholders. More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Rodriguez et al unpublished evidence). Feasibility Limited knowledge and training of staff on the prevention and management of malaria in pregnancy, including indications for IPTp-SP, contribute to poor uptake. Some health care workers expressed concerns over the lack of ongoing training to update their knowledge, although this was country- and site-dependent. Other issues that impaired the delivery of IPTp included stockouts of SP, under-prescribing of SP (< three doses), and inadequate staffing. DOT was generally, but not always, associated with improved uptake of IPTp-SP. Utilization of DOT was variable, with between 5% and 67% of pregnant women reporting taking IPTp-SP under DOT [118][119][120][121]. The GDG considered IPTp implementation to be feasible, given that it is delivered through ANC.",

    "content": "supplemented by a cross-cutting review on chemoprevention and drug resistance (Plowe unpublished evidence), a civil society consultation report on chemoprevention (CS4ME unpublished evidence) and contributions from the GDG membership, which included former and current national malaria programme representatives. The GDG was supported by a Steering Group, which included representatives from the WHO Departments for Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research and Child Health and Development. The systematic review addressed the GDG’s PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) question regarding whether women of all gravidities should be given SP as malaria chemoprevention to reduce disease burden in pregnancy and/or adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. In particular, the systematic review assessed the potential modifying effects of gravidity, malaria transmission intensity, and SP resistance on the effectiveness of IPTp-SP. The main outcomes of interest considered by the GDG in the systematic review were maternal anaemia and low birthweight. Other outcomes of interest included maternal clinical malaria, placental infection, malaria infection, severe malaria, adverse events, hospitalization, and death; and fetal/infant adverse pregnancy outcomes (spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or preterm delivery), malaria infection, anaemia, severe malaria, hospital admissions, and death. Overall, 102 studies and 105,276 participants contributed to the systematic review. This included seven trials comparing IPTp-SP to placebo or passive case detection, 12 trials or cohorts following women who received IPTp-SP, and 83 observational studies. The studies covered all gravidae. All the included studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, with more studies situated in Central and West Africa (59.3%) than in Eastern and Southern Africa (40.7%). Given that IPTp is an intervention that has proven to be effective, for ethical reasons, no new placebo-controlled trials have been conducted since the last update to the IPTp recommendation. This review therefore included a large number of observational studies. Summary of judgements: The Evidence-to-Decision framework captures the evidence from the systematic review considered by the GDG. The GDG determined that the balance between desirable and undesirable effects favoured IPTp; negligible costs and savings were associated with IPTp implementation delivered through ANC contacts; the certainty of the evidence on required resources was moderate; and IPTp was probably cost-effective, probably acceptable to key stakeholders, and feasible to implement. The GDG concluded that a strong recommendation should be made for IPTp based on its moderate beneficial effects, small undesirable effects, and moderate-certainty evidence. Implementation: Please refer to the WHO policy brief for the implementation of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) [128] and the WHO recommendations on antenatal care for a positive pregnancy experience [130]. A field guide on community deployment of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was released in January 2024 [129]. A manual for subnational tailoring of malaria interventions is under development. Evaluation: The safety and impact of IPTp programmes should be routinely monitored. The effect of IPTp may be evaluated using routine data on hospital deliveries, clinic and/or community health worker data. The WHO chemoprevention efficacy study (CPES) protocol should be used to monitor the efficacy of medicines used for chemoprevention. Although the potential effect of chemoprevention on the spread of drug resistance may be monitored by the analysis of molecular markers associated with treatment outcomes, the correlation between molecular markers and the efficacy of antimalarials for chemoprevention is unclear and results should be interpreted with caution. Given that SP continues to have positive outcomes for mother and baby even in areas of very high SP resistance, national malaria programmes may want to continue IPTp-SP programmes, despite worsening efficacy on malaria-specific outcomes. Research needs: Several evidence gaps were identified regarding IPTp. None should prevent adoption and implementation of IPTp. Nevertheless, impact could potentially be enhanced by determining: the effectiveness of alternative drug regimens for IPTp, including SP + dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAP); the non-malarial effect of SP on pregnancy outcomes; the effectiveness of alternative approaches to IPTp delivery (e.g. community-based approaches) to improve uptake and address inequities in coverage compared to comparable investment in ANC services. Data on the safety and effectiveness of alternatives to SP for IPTp will be reviewed by WHO when the relevant meta-analyses are available. Despite a near complete loss of its antimalarial effects in areas of very high SP resistance, SP continues to positively impact fetal growth and maternal anaemia. This may be mediated through a non-malarial pathway. This is consistent with the results of an individual patient data meta-analysis, including data from six trials comparing IPTp with DHAP vs IPTp with SP. These data showed that IPTp with DHAP was much more effective than SP in reducing malaria in areas of high SP resistance. However, this did not translate into better pregnancy outcomes, primarily because SP was associated with better fetal growth and thus higher mean birthweights in all gravidae. This may reflect the broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of sulfadoxine, a long-acting sulfonamide, and the associated reduced risk of persistent bacterial infections, and/or its influence on the maternal gut microbiome, and/or its ability to reduce inflammation (Gutman et al unpublished evidence (a)). 4.2.2 Perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC) - formerly intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in infants (IPTi). Perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC) is the administration of a full treatment course of an antimalarial medicine at predefined intervals, regardless of whether the child is infected with malaria, in order to prevent illness in moderate to high perennial malaria transmission settings. The goal of PMC is to protect young children by establishing preventive antimalarial drug concentrations in the blood that clear existing infections and prevent new ones during the age of greatest risk of severe malaria. Previously, this recommendation referred to intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi). Since the initial recommendation, additional data have documented the value of malaria chemoprevention in children aged 12 to 24 months. The name has been changed to PMC because the updated recommendation no longer limits the intervention specifically to infants and reflects the malaria transmission settings in which the intervention should be considered. Practical info: Antimalarial medicine: WHO recommends that medicines used for PMC be different from those used as first-line malaria treatment. SP has been widely used...",

    "content": "Conditional recommendation for, Moderate certainty evidence Perennial malaria chemoprevention (2022) In areas of moderate to high perennial malaria transmission, children belonging to age groups at high risk of severe malaria can be given antimalarial medicines at predefined intervals to reduce disease burden. • Perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC) schedules should be informed by the age pattern of severe malaria admissions, the duration of protection of the selected drug, and the feasibility and affordability of delivering each additional PMC course (see “Practical info”). • Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) has been widely used for chemoprevention in Africa, including for PMC. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) have been effective when used for PMC, but evidence is limited on their safety, efficacy, adherence to multi-day regimens, and cost-effectiveness in the context of PMC. • Previously, PMC was recommended in infants (<12 months of age) as intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi). Since the initial recommendation, new data have documented the value of malaria chemoprevention in children aged 12 to 24 months. • The Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) platform remains important for delivering PMC. Other methods of delivery can be explored to optimize access to PMC and integration with other health interventions. • Moderate to high perennial malaria transmission settings are defined as areas with P. falciparum parasite prevalence greater than 10% or an annual parasite incidence greater than 250 per 1000 [30]. These thresholds are indicative and should not be regarded as absolutes for determining applicability of the PMC recommendation. because the updated recommendation no longer limits the intervention specifically to infants and reflects the malaria transmission settings in which the intervention should be considered. Practical info Antimalarial medicine WHO recommends that medicines used for PMC be different from those used as first-line malaria treatment. SP has been widely used for chemoprevention in Africa and has been shown to be efficacious, safe, well tolerated, available and inexpensive. SP was evaluated in 10 trials for PMC, artesunate-amodiaquine (AS+AQ) in one trial, DHAP in one trial, and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine + artesunate (SP+AS) in one trial [126]. All regimens were found to be effective in reducing clinical malaria. Although ACTs have been effective when used for PMC, evidence is limited on their safety (including potential cumulative toxicity), efficacy, adherence to multi-day regimens, and cost-effectiveness in the context of PMC in young children. A drug regimen that can be administered as a directly observed single dose, such as SP, is preferable to multi-day regimens. Age group The target age group should be identified using local data on the age distribution of malaria admissions and severe disease. Previously, PMC was recommended in infants (<12 months of age) as IPTi based on evidence generated in this age group and an appreciation of the disease burden they bear. Since the initial recommendation, additional data have documented the value of malaria chemoprevention in children aged 12 to 24 months. Three studies evaluated PMC doses in children aged 12 to 15 months [127][128][129], and one study evaluated monthly doses in children up to 24 months [130]. Evidence from seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) programmes, where the age of the target population overlaps with that of PMC, also shows that the impact of chemoprevention on disease burden can be sustained beyond infancy with additional doses. However, there is limited information on the safety and efficacy of malaria chemoprevention in children >15 months of age in perennial transmission settings. Dosage Children in age groups at increased risk of severe disease should be given a complete course of antimalarials, at their recommended treatment dose, as PMC. The drug dosage should be determined by the child’s weight wherever possible, with dosing according to age only in situations where the child’s weight is unknown. Frequency The PMC schedule should be informed by the length of protective efficacy of the selected drug, as well as the feasibility of delivering each additional PMC course. SP doses should be given at least one month apart. Eight trials have evaluated a range of 3–6 doses of SP for PMC in the first year of life. Four trials have evaluated 1–12 doses of SP for PMC in the second year of life. The safety and impact of PMC programmes should be routinely monitored. Delivery The EPI platform remains important for delivering PMC, especially in the first year of life, and it may be possible to make use of the EPI or other routine health visits, or establish new contacts to reach children over 1 year of age. Research on alternative approaches for PMC delivery beyond the EPI schedules may be warranted. Consideration should be given to contextual factors such as values and preferences of end-users, costs, coverage and sustainability of alternative delivery platforms. Drug resistance The impact of drug resistance on the protection provided by PMC with SP is currently unclear. The duration of protection of SP has been shown to be 42 days in settings without parasite resistance mutations. This was reduced to 21 days in a setting where 89% of parasites carried the quintuple mutation [131]. In settings with a Pfdhps540 mutation frequency of up to 50%, 3–4 doses of PMC with SP reduced clinical malaria by 30% over the first year of life [131]. However, in the setting where the Pfdhps540 mutation frequency was 89%, no overall protective effect of PMC was observed [131]. The efficacy of SP for treatment is affected by the frequency of mutation-carrying parasites, but there is little evidence that the frequency of molecular markers predicts the efficacy of PMC. Contraindications PMC is not recommended for individuals receiving other forms of malaria chemoprevention (e.g. SMC or MDA). Although PMC and SMC could, in principle, be delivered to different age groups in the same geographical area, for example where there is perennial malaria transmission with seasonal peaks, there is no operational experience of the co-delivery of these strategies. There is currently no experience of co-administration of PMC with the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine. PMC is not recommended in children with severe acute illness or those who are unable to take oral medication, children who during the last 30 days received a dose of any of the drugs being used for PMC, or those allergic to any of the drugs being used for PMC. PMC with SP should not be given to individuals receiving a sulfa-based medication as treatment or prophylaxis, including co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole). Other considerations Information about PMC should be fully accessible to caregivers and key stakeholders, such as government officials and religious leaders. As with all health interventions, consent should be obtained from the caregiver on behalf of the child prior to administration of PMC. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms • Clinical malaria: PMC probably reduces the risk of clinical malaria compared to placebo or no PMC when using SP (rate ratio: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.69–0.88), AS-AQ (rate ratio: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.61–0.94).",

Evidence to decision Benefits and harms • Clinical malaria: PMC probably reduces the risk of clinical malaria compared to placebo or no PMC when using SP (rate ratio: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.69–0.88), AS-AQ (rate ratio: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.61–0.94), DHAP (rate ratio: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.33–0.54) (all moderate-certainty evidence), or SP+AS (rate ratio: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.62–0.97; high-certainty evidence). • Severe malaria: PMC may reduce the risk of severe malaria compared to placebo or no PMC when using SP (rate ratio: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.47–1.81; low-certainty evidence), but may increase the risk of severe malaria when using DHAP (rate ratio: 1.29; 95% CI: 0.28–5.98; low-certainty evidence). There was no reported evidence on the effect of PMC with AS-AQ or SP+AS on severe malaria within the included studies. • Anaemia: PMC probably reduces the risk of anaemia compared to placebo or no PMC when using SP (rate ratio: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.68–0.98), AS-AQ (rate ratio: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.53–1.12) or SP+AS (rate ratio: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.49–1.07) (all moderate-certainty evidence). No data were available on this outcome for DHAP in the meta-analysis. • All-cause hospital admissions: PMC probably reduces hospital admissions compared to placebo or no PMC when using SP (rate ratio: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.78–0.93; moderate-certainty evidence) and probably has little effect when using AS-AQ (rate ratio: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.76–1.27; moderate-certainty evidence), SP+AS (rate ratio: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.71–1.20; moderate-certainty evidence) or DHAP (rate ratio: 1.58; 95% CI: 0.46–5.42; low-certainty evidence). Malaria-specific hospital admissions were not covered by the systematic review. • All-cause mortality: PMC probably reduces the risk of death compared to placebo or no PMC when using SP (risk ratio: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.74–1.15; moderate-certainty evidence) or SP+AS (risk ratio: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.36–1.89; moderate-certainty evidence), and may reduce mortality when using DHAP (risk ratio: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.01–8.08; low-certainty evidence). Although available evidence suggests that AS-AQ probably increases the risk of death (risk ratio: 1.21; 95% CI: 0.58–2.55; moderate-certainty evidence), the actual effect varies, and it is possible that there is little or no difference. • Parasitaemia: PMC probably reduces the risk of parasitaemia compared to placebo or no PMC when using SP (rate ratio: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.56–0.79; moderate-certainty evidence). No data were available on this outcome for AS-AQ, SP+AS or DHAP in the meta-analysis. • Adverse events: In one study, the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms was higher in children who received PMC with SP compared to placebo (risk ratio: 2.25; 95% CI: 1.51–3.35) [127]. • Potential drug–vaccine interactions and blood transfusions were outcomes not covered by the systematic review. However, a study done in a subset of children enrolled in five randomized controlled trials in Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique and the United Republic of Tanzania found that PMC with SP did not affect the serological response to EPI vaccines [130]. More information on the evidence can be found in the systematic review [126]. Moderate Certainty of the evidence The overall certainty of the evidence for the outcomes of interest was considered moderate by the GDG. Although the certainty of evidence, summarized under “Benefits and harms”, ranged from low to high, the priority outcomes of clinical malaria and anaemia were assessed as moderate-certainty evidence, while severe malaria was considered low-certainty evidence. More information on the certainty of evidence assessments can be found in the ‘research evidence’ tab associated with this recommendation online or in the annex of the pdf version. Values and preferences Preferences and values of the target population were determined by: • consultation with civil society, which indicated that chemoprevention to prevent malaria disease in children under 5 years was seen as a priority in endemic areas (CS4ME unpublished evidence); • a synthesis of contextual factors from trials and pilots of PMC, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa, which showed that PMC is generally widely accepted by caregivers (Steinhardt unpublished evidence (a)). The GDG determined that there was probably no important uncertainty or variability in how the outcomes of PMC are valued across contexts. More information can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Steinhardt unpublished evidence (a)) and civil society consultation report (CS4ME unpublished evidence). Resources PMC is generally considered cost-effective or highly cost-effective due to its use of the EPI delivery platform to deliver the inexpensive drug SP. The cost per dose delivered in nearly all studies was less than $0.25 for PMC with SP, but more expensive with alternative drugs. PMC becomes less cost-effective in settings with a lower malaria burden, as there is less potential to avert disease, and with the use of more expensive medicines. The GDG considered the overall costs of implementing PMC with SP in children to be moderate and judged that PMC is probably cost-effective compared to no intervention. More information on the evidence can be found in the evidence profile associated with this recommendation. Justification This recommendation was developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework [122]. Sources of information Recommendation development was informed by a systematic review [126], independently evaluated using the AMSTAR-2 Checklist [134] (Steinhardt et al unpublished evidence (b)), and a report summarizing evidence from published studies on contextual factors related to PMC implementation (Steinhardt unpublished evidence (a)), including cost-effectiveness, feasibility, equity, values and acceptability. These sources of information were supplemented by a cross-cutting review on chemoprevention drug resistance (Plowe unpublished evidence), a civil society consultation report on chemoprevention (CS4ME unpublished evidence) and contributions from the GDG membership, which included former and current national malaria programme representatives. The systematic review addressed the GDG’s PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) question regarding whether children living in settings with perennial malaria transmission should be given antimalarial medicines as chemoprevention to reduce disease burden. The main outcomes of interest were the impact of PMC on confirmed clinical malaria, severe malaria, and anaemia. Other outcomes of interest included: hospital admissions (all-cause and malaria-specific); all-cause mortality; adverse events; drug–vaccine interactions; parasite prevalence; and blood transfusions. Twelve trials were included in the review, three of which were cluster-randomized controlled trials. All the trials were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa: Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Uganda, and the United Republic of Tanzania. SP was evaluated in 10 trials, amodiaquine in one trial, AS-AQ in one.",

The GDG considered the overall costs of implementing PMC with SP in children to be moderate and judged that PMC is probably cost-effective compared to no intervention. More information on the evidence can be found in the evidence profile associated with this recommendation. Equity Little information on equity of PMC is available. One study found no association between wealth quintile and coverage of PMC [132]. The GDG considered that PMC probably increases health equity when delivered using the EPI platform, since access to EPI is generally equitable and coverage tends to be high. More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Steinhardt unpublished evidence (a)). Acceptability PMC has been widely accepted by caregivers, especially when delivered alongside vaccinations using the EPI platform. EPI has also been generally well accepted and perceived as beneficial. Despite some health workers not liking the process of administering PMC and some complaints that it increased workload, most had positive perceptions of PMC, with some suggesting that it improved EPI attendance. The GDG considered that PMC was probably acceptable to key stakeholders. More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Steinhardt unpublished evidence (a)). Feasibility Despite logistical challenges such as access to clean water, crushing the tablets, and occasional drug shortages, PMC implementation appears feasible when it is delivered through the EPI platform. One time-and-motion study in the United Republic of Tanzania found that the median time used for PMC implementation was 12.4 minutes (ranging from 1.6 minutes to 28.9 minutes) per nurse per vaccination session [133]. The GDG considered PMC implementation to be feasible. More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Steinhardt unpublished evidence (a)). WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) 112 of 478 trial, DHAP in one trial, and SP+AS in one trial1. The systematic review included trials that compared PMC with no intervention in young children (aged eight weeks to 24 months), with length of follow-up ranging from nine to 36 months of age, and most studies delivering 3–4 doses of antimalarial. The AMSTAR-2 Checklist assessment concluded that the systematic review was well conducted and covered most of the outcomes identified by the GDG in the PICO question (Steinhardt et al unpublished evidence (b)). Three outcomes of interest to the GDG were not covered by the systematic review, namely malaria-specific hospital admissions, blood transfusions, and potential drug–vaccine interactions. Summary of judgements The Evidence-to-Decision table captures the evidence from the systematic review considered by the GDG. The GDG determined that the balance between desirable and undesirable effects favoured PMC; moderate costs were associated with PMC implementation delivered through EPI; PMC was considered probably cost-effective, but the use of alternative delivery strategies to EPI may affect the cost-effectiveness of PMC, as might the use of more expensive antimalarials; and PMC was probably acceptable to key stakeholders and feasible to implement. The GDG concluded that a conditional recommendation should be made for PMC based on its moderate beneficial effect and moderate certainty of evidence. 1 Three trials evaluated more than one drug for PMC. Implementation Please refer to the Intermittent preventive treatment for infants using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTi-SP) for malaria control in Africa: implementation field guide [135]. Evaluation The effect of introducing PMC may be evaluated using routine hospital, clinic and/or community health worker data. The WHO chemoprevention efficacy study (CPES) protocol should be used to monitor the efficacy of medicines when used for chemoprevention. Although the potential effect of chemoprevention on the spread of drug resistance may be monitored by the analysis of molecular markers associated with treatment outcomes, the correlation between molecular markers and the efficacy of antimalarials for chemoprevention is unclear and results should be interpreted with caution. Research needs Several evidence gaps were identified regarding PMC. None should prevent adoption and implementation of PMC. Nevertheless, impact could potentially be enhanced by determining: • the efficacy of PMC with SP, and alternative PMC regimens, within 28 days of administration; • updated costs and cost-effectiveness of PMC delivered through the EPI, including in settings with low coverage of routine childhood immunization; • the effectiveness of different SP dosing schedules for PMC in children aged eight weeks up to 24 months; • the effect of administering PMC to children >24 months old; • the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of alternative combination drugs for PMC (e.g. sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine [SP+AQ]); • the costs of and coverage achieved by alternative approaches to delivering PMC; • the effectiveness of PMC in different antimalarial drug resistance contexts. 4.2.3 Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) is the intermittent administration of a curative dose of antimalarial medicine during the malaria season, regardless of whether the child is infected with malaria. The objective of SMC is to establish antimalarial drug concentrations in the blood that clear existing infections and prevent new ones during the period of greatest malaria risk. SMC is recommended in areas of seasonal malaria transmission. WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) 113 of 478 Practical info Antimalarial medicine WHO recommends a combination medicine for SMC that is different from that used for first-line malaria treatment. The component medicines should have closely matched pharmacology, such that no component is present in the absence of other components for more than a minimal amount of time in order to reduce the risk of new infections encountering only a single drug. SP+AQ has been evaluated in 12 studies of SMC and has been widely used for SMC in Africa. SP+AQ has been shown to be efficacious, safe, well tolerated, available and inexpensive (Thwing et al unpublished evidence). The prevalence of molecular markers of resistance to SP+AQ was low in the general population before and two years after SMC implementation in seven countries in west and central Africa (Bhattarai et al unpublished evidence). Safety and efficacy have been evaluated for several other drug combinations, but the lack of widescale implementation means that fewer data are available on the potential risks of cumulative toxicity and impact on drug resistance. Age group Most research studies have evaluated SMC in children aged 3–59 months. SMC given to children <5 years old reduced the risk of clinical malaria by almost three quarters (risk ratio: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.25–0.29) during the transmission season (Thwing et al unpublished evidence). SMC has also been shown to reduce the incidence of clinical malaria in children <10 years old. Studies conducted in one country comparing the effect of SMC among children <5 years old with that in children 5–9 years old found no",

SMC has also been shown to reduce the incidence of clinical malaria in children <10 years old. Studies conducted in one country comparing the effect of SMC among children <5 years old with that in children 5–9 years old found no difference in the effect size for malaria incidence or prevalence, severe malaria, or anaemia (Thwing et al unpublished evidence). The age group targeted for SMC should be informed by the local age pattern of severe malaria admissions. The cost-effectiveness of SMC will become less favourable as programmes expand to age groups at lower risk of severe disease and areas of lower malaria transmission [136]. Dosage Children in age groups at increased risk of severe disease should be given a complete course of antimalarials, at their recommended treatment dose, as SMC. The drug dosage should be determined by the child’s weight wherever possible, with dosing according to age only in situations where the child’s weight is unknown. Frequency The number of cycles should be informed by the duration of the high-transmission season, based on the local malaria epidemiology, and the length of preventive efficacy of the selected drug combination. SMC should be used to protect children during the entire high-transmission season. Current evidence supports monthly administration of SMC for 3–4 cycles in shorter transmission settings, and up to six cycles have been evaluated in settings with longer transmission seasons (Thwing et al unpublished evidence). Delivery SMC can be provided through door-to-door or fixed-point delivery. A study in Mali found that door-to-door delivery achieved significantly higher coverage than fixed-point delivery (76.1% versus 62.2%, p = 0.0028) [137]. Further studies in Mali and Gambia have supported that door-to-door delivery can achieve high coverage [138][139]. Studies found similar SMC coverage in children given directly observed treatment compared to non-directly observed treatment [137][138]. Strong recommendation for, Moderate certainty evidence. Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (2022). In areas of seasonal malaria transmission, children belonging to age groups at high risk of severe malaria should be given antimalarial medicines during peak malaria transmission seasons to reduce disease burden. • Eligibility for seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) is defined by the seasonality of malaria transmission and age groups at risk of severe malaria. Thresholds for assessing these criteria change over time and location. Malaria programmes should assess the suitability of SMC based on the local malaria epidemiology and available funding (see “Practical info”). The added value of a seasonally targeted intervention is likely to be greatest where transmission is intensely seasonal. • Monthly cycles of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine (SP+AQ) have been widely used for SMC in African children under 5 years old and have been shown to be efficacious, safe, well tolerated, available and inexpensive (Thwing et al unpublished evidence). Drug resistance While some prospective trials and ecological studies of SMC with SP+AQ in West Africa have reported increased prevalence of the dhfr/dhps quadruple and quintuple mutants, other studies have found no evidence of selection. No evidence has been reported of SMC being followed by increased prevalence of the higher level resistance mutations that most severely impair curative SP efficacy, nor does SMC appear to select for parasites carrying mutations associated with diminished AQ susceptibility (Plowe unpublished evidence). Contraindications SMC is not recommended for individuals receiving other forms of malaria chemoprevention (e.g. MDA or PMC). Although PMC and SMC could, in principle, be delivered to different age groups in the same geographical area (e.g. where there is perennial malaria transmission with seasonal peaks), there is no operational experience of the co-delivery of these strategies. SMC is not recommended for children with severe acute illness or those who are unable to take oral medication, children who during the last 30 days received a dose of any of the drugs being used for SMC, or children with an allergy to any of the drugs being used for SMC. Children should not be given SMC including SP if they are receiving a sulfa-based medication as treatment or prophylaxis, including co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole). Other considerations Information about SMC should be fully accessible to caregivers and key stakeholders, such as government officials and religious leaders. As with all health interventions, consent should be obtained from the caregiver on behalf of the child prior to administration of SMC. Evidence to decision Benefits and harms • Clinical malaria: SMC probably reduces the incidence of confirmed clinical malaria in children (<5 years old: rate ratio: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.25–0.29; moderate-certainty evidence; 5–15 years: rate ratio: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.25–0.30; low-certainty evidence). The effect size was similar when compared according to the number of cycles (3–6 cycles), transmission setting (moderate vs high intensity), or drug regimen used (SP+AQ, AS-AQ or SP+AS). Studies conducted in one country showed no difference in effect size against clinical malaria incidence between children <5 years and those 5–9 years. However, the absolute impact in older age groups will vary according to the age pattern of disease in different settings. • Parasite prevalence: SMC probably reduces the prevalence of malaria infection at the end of the transmission season in children under 5 years old (risk ratio: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.34–0.43; moderate-certainty evidence) and reduces the prevalence of malaria infection at the end of the transmission season in children <10 years old (risk ratio: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.17–0.44; high-certainty evidence). The effect was similar when compared according to the number of cycles (3–6 cycles), transmission setting (moderate vs high), or drug regimen (SP+AQ, AS-AQ or SP+AS). • Severe malaria: 3–4 cycles of SP+AQ as SMC reduces the incidence of severe malaria in children <5 years old (rate ratio: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.37–0.89; high-certainty evidence) and probably reduces severe malaria incidence in children 5–9 years old (rate ratio: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.23–0.84; moderate-certainty evidence). • Anaemia: SMC probably reduces the prevalence of any anaemia (haemoglobin <11 mg/dL) at the end of the transmission season in children <5 years old (risk ratio: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.80–0.88; moderate-certainty evidence). SMC reduces the prevalence of any anaemia (haemoglobin <11 mg/dL) at the end of the transmission season in children 5–9 years old (risk ratio: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.52–0.95; high-certainty evidence). • Hospital admissions: SMC probably reduces the incidence of all-cause hospitalization in children <5 years in high-transmission areas (SP+AQ, high-transmission, 3–4 cycles: rate ratio: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.31–0.94; high-certainty evidence; AS-AQ, 5–6 cycles: rate ratio: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.20–0.87; high-certainty evidence; SP+AQ, 3–4 cycles: rate ratio: 1.38; 95% CI: 0.71–2.67; moderate-certainty evidence). • All-cause mortality: There is little evidence of effect of SMC on all-cause mortality in the community.",

All-cause mortality: There is little evidence of effect of SMC on all-cause mortality in the community (low-certainty evidence). See notes for further information. Adverse events: SMC increases mild to moderate adverse events in children up to 15 years (risk ratio: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.31–1.51; high-certainty evidence). The most frequent features reported in children receiving SMC (with SP+AQ or SP+AS) were nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Incidence of infection, blood transfusions, and school attendance were not reported in any of the eligible studies. More information can be found in the systematic review (Thwing et al unpublished evidence). Notes: Results from non-randomized studies were consistent with those from randomized studies across all reported outcomes (incidence of confirmed clinical malaria; prevalence of infection at end of transmission season; prevalence of moderate anaemia; incidence of severe malaria; hospitalization; and all-cause mortality, all for children <5 years), except for prevalence of moderate anaemia, where no effect was observed. Adverse events were not reported. There was little evidence of an effect on all-cause mortality. It is plausible that a reduction in severe malaria could translate into an impact on mortality. This was observed in one of the studies that was excluded from the systematic review as it did not use a controlled design [140]. However, the evidence is hard to ascertain due to potential risk of bias from the study designs (trials with clinical malaria as the main outcome are likely to minimize mortality) and systems for reporting deaths in the studies. Implementation of SMC was associated with reductions in malaria deaths in hospitals by 42.4% (95% CI: 5.9–40.9) in Burkina Faso and by 56.6% (95% CI: 28.9–73.5) in Gambia [140]. Moderate Certainty of the evidence: The overall certainty of the evidence for the outcomes of interest was considered to be moderate. The certainty of evidence, as summarized under “Benefits and harms”, ranged from low to high. The priority outcome of confirmed clinical malaria was assessed as moderate-certainty evidence. More information on the certainty of evidence assessments can be found in the ‘research evidence’ tab associated with this recommendation online or in the annex of the pdf version. Values and preferences: Preferences and values of the target population were determined by: consultation with civil society, which indicated that chemoprevention to prevent malaria disease in children under 5 years was seen as a priority in endemic areas (CS4ME unpublished evidence); a synthesis of contextual factors from trials and pilots of SMC (Bhattarai et al unpublished evidence), but no research was identified that described values and preferences related to SMC. The GDG determined that there was probably no important uncertainty or variability in how the main outcomes of SMC are valued. More information can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Bhattarai et al unpublished evidence) and the civil society consultation report (CS4ME unpublished evidence). Resources: The GDG considered the overall costs of implementing SMC to be moderate. Important cost drivers of SMC are the drug used and the mode of delivery (e.g. door-to-door vs fixed-point). SMC is considered a cost-effective addition to standard care, with the estimated average total economic cost per malaria case averted ranging from US$ 2.91 to US $67.77, depending, in part, on the choice of drug (Bhattarai et al unpublished evidence). Expanding SMC to children in age groups beyond those at highest risk of severe disease, areas of lower malaria transmission, and the use of more expensive antimalarials will likely influence the cost-effectiveness of SMC. More information can be found in the summary of contextual factors report for SMC (Bhattarai et al unpublished evidence). Equity: The GDG considered that SMC is likely to enhance equitable service delivery based on similar coverage of the intervention across wealth quintiles in all countries where it is being implemented (Bhattarai et al unpublished evidence). There was generally no significant difference in SMC coverage by age or gender. More information can be found in the summary of contextual factors report for SMC (Bhattarai et al unpublished evidence). Justification: This recommendation was developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework [122]. Sources of information: WHO commissioned a systematic review to inform this guidance on SMC (Thwing et al unpublished evidence), and a separate report summarizing evidence from published studies on contextual factors related to SMC implementation (Bhattarai et al unpublished evidence), including cost-effectiveness, feasibility, equity, values and acceptability. These sources of information were supplemented by a cross-cutting review on chemoprevention drug resistance (Plowe unpublished evidence), a civil society consultation report on chemoprevention (CS4ME unpublished evidence) and contributions from the GDG membership, which included former and current national malaria programme representatives. The objectives of the systematic review were to assess the effect of SMC with antimalarial drugs on malaria disease burden among children living in places with seasonal malaria transmission, with a specific focus on the age of the children (3–59 months vs 60–120 months of age), the number of treatment cycles during a season (3–4 cycles vs 5–6 cycles), and the drug regimen; and to summarize contextual information regarding acceptability, feasibility, equity, safety, drug resistance, cost and cost-effectiveness. The primary outcome of interest was incidence of confirmed clinical malaria. Other outcomes included: parasite prevalence; incidence of infection; anaemia prevalence; blood transfusions; hospital admissions; severe malaria; all-cause mortality; adverse reactions; and school attendance. Seventeen studies met the criteria for inclusion (12 randomized and five non-randomized studies) and were included in the review. All studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, including in Burkina Faso, Gambia, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria and Senegal. Twelve studies used SP+AQ, three studies used AS-AQ, one study used SP+AS, and one study used AL. Trials administering three to four cycles were usually located in the sites with shorter transmission seasons, whereas studies administering five to six cycles were in areas with longer transmission seasons. None of the included studies reported incidence of infection or blood transfusions as outcome measures. One study reported education outcomes but not school attendance. Summary of judgements: Evidence from the systematic review (Thwing et al unpublished evidence) and supporting information (Bhattarai et al unpublished evidence; CS4ME unpublished evidence; Plowe unpublished evidence) was appraised by the GDG in October 2021, a summary.",

Summary of judgements Evidence from the systematic review (Thwing et al unpublished evidence) and supporting information (Bhattarai et al unpublished evidence; CS4ME unpublished evidence; Plowe unpublished evidence) was appraised by the GDG in October 2021, a summary of which is provided in the Evidence-to-Decision table. The GDG determined that SMC has a large beneficial effect and that the balance of desirable and undesirable effects favours SMC; the costs of implementing SMC are moderate, although the overall cost would be affected by the drug used and the mode of SMC delivery; SMC is cost-effective, but expanding SMC to age groups beyond those at highest risk of severe disease or areas of lower malaria transmission, and the use of more expensive antimalarials could reduce its cost-effectiveness; SMC is an acceptable intervention; SMC delivery approaches and coverage varied across countries, but were judged to be feasible. In sum, the GDG judged the overall certainty of the evidence as moderate and strongly recommended SMC for age groups at high risk of severe malaria living in areas of seasonal malaria transmission to reduce disease burden. Implementation Please refer to the Seasonal malaria chemoprevention with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine in children: A field guide. Second edition [141]. Acceptability SMC acceptability was generally high, with overall refusal rates <1% in five countries (Bhattarai et al unpublished evidence). Consequently, the GDG considered SMC to be acceptable to key stakeholders. More information can be found in the summary of contextual factors report for SMC (Bhattarai et al unpublished evidence). Feasibility SMC delivery approaches and coverage vary across countries. For example, in Mali, SMC coverage was significantly higher in children who received SMC using door-to-door delivery compared to fixed-point delivery (76.1% versus 62.2%, p = 0.0028), while in Gambia, SMC delivery through village health workers achieved a substantially higher coverage level than delivery by reproductive and child health teams (74% versus 48%, a difference of 27%; 95% CI: 16%–38%) [137]. Overall, the GDG considered SMC implementation to be feasible. More information can be found in the summary of contextual factors report for SMC (Bhattarai et al unpublished evidence). Evaluation The effect of introducing SMC may be evaluated using routine hospital, clinic and/or community health worker data. The WHO chemoprevention efficacy study (CPES) protocol should be used to monitor the efficacy of medicines when used for chemoprevention. Although the potential effect of chemoprevention on the spread of drug resistance may be monitored by the analysis of molecular markers associated with treatment outcomes, the correlation between molecular markers and the efficacy of antimalarials for chemoprevention is unclear and results should be interpreted with caution. Research needs The GDG highlighted the following evidence gaps requiring further research. These relate to: • the operational effectiveness of SMC; • the value of administering SMC to children ≥10 years old; • the effectiveness of SMC in areas with seasonal but >6 months of malaria transmission; • the effectiveness of SMC in areas with antimalarial drug resistance; • better understanding of the pharmacokinetics of drugs used for chemoprevention and concentrations required to prevent parasite growth (as opposed to therapeutic concentrations); • the efficacy and effectiveness of delivering SMC with other drug combinations and intervals between cycles. 4.2.4 Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in school-aged children (IPTsc) Intermittent preventive treatment in school-aged children (IPTsc) is the administration of a full treatment course of an antimalarial medicine at regular intervals to treat and prevent malaria infections in children who are old enough to attend school. Practical info Antimalarial medicine Drug regimens evaluated for IPTsc and found to be effective include SP combined with an aminoquinoline (either AQ or piperaquine), SP+AS, and artemisinin-based combination therapy including an aminoquinoline (AS-AQ or DHAP)1. SP+AQ has been widely used for chemoprevention in West Africa and has been shown to be efficacious, safe, well tolerated, available and inexpensive. In order to reduce the risk of drug resistance to life-saving drugs, first- and second-line malaria treatments should not be used for IPTsc if safe and effective alternatives are available. The possibility of interactions with other drugs delivered as part of school health programmes should be considered. Conditional recommendation for , Low certainty evidence Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in school-aged children (2022) School-aged children living in malaria-endemic settings with moderate to high perennial or seasonal transmission can be given a full therapeutic course of antimalarial medicine at predetermined times as chemoprevention to reduce disease burden. • Intermittent preventive treatment in school-aged children (IPTsc) has been evaluated in children aged 5–15 years. The burden of malaria and benefits of IPTsc may vary across this age range, but evidence is limited. • National malaria programmes can consider IPTsc if resources allow for its introduction among school-aged children without compromising chemoprevention interventions for those carrying the highest burden of severe disease, such as children < 5 years old. • Schools may provide a low-cost means to deliver chemoprevention to school-aged children. However seasonal variation in malaria transmission and the timing of school terms, as well as equity concerns, may mean alternative delivery channels are needed to maximize impact. • First- and second-line malaria treatments should not be used for IPTsc if safe and effective alternatives are available (see “Practical info”). • The dosing schedule for IPTsc should be informed by the local malaria epidemiology and timed to give protection during the period of greatest malaria risk (see “Practical info”). • Moderate to high malaria transmission settings are defined as areas with P. falciparum parasite prevalence greater than 10% or an annual parasite incidence greater than 250 per 1000 [30]. These thresholds are indicative and should not be regarded as absolutes for determining applicability of the IPTsc recommendation. Age group The target age group should be identified using local data on the age distribution of malaria admissions and severe disease. As young children (≤ 59 months) are the most vulnerable to severe malaria, chemoprevention interventions to protect this age group should be prioritized over those for school-aged children. If resources allow for introduction of chemoprevention for school-aged children without compromising chemoprevention in younger children, national malaria programmes can consider IPTsc. The majority of IPTsc studies have evaluated the intervention in children under 15 years old. There is some evidence of a stronger effect on malaria-related anaemia in children younger than 10 years versus those who are 10–15 years. However, the effect of IPTsc on P. falciparum infection was similar across these two age groups.",

    "content": "The majority of IPTsc studies have evaluated the intervention in children under 15 years old. There is some evidence of a stronger effect on malaria-related anaemia in children younger than 10 years versus those who are 10–15 years. However, the effect of IPTsc on P. falciparum infection was similar across these two age groups. If older age groups are included in IPTsc, particular consideration should be given on how best to include girls with a history of menarche. Certain antimalarials should not be given for chemoprevention without first confirming pregnancy status. There is insufficient information on the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of most antimalarial agents in pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester. In IPTsc studies that have included girls with a history of menarche, pregnancy status has been determined either through self-reporting or the use of pregnancy tests. Further research is needed on how best to safely include girls of reproductive age in IPTsc.\nDosage: School-aged children should be given a complete course of antimalarials at their recommended treatment dose as IPTsc. The drug dosage should be determined by the child’s weight wherever possible, with dosing according to age only in situations where the child’s weight is unknown or cannot be determined.\nFrequency: The IPTsc schedule should be informed by the local malaria epidemiology, particularly transmission intensity and seasonality, the pharmacokinetics of the drug used, and the feasibility of delivering each additional IPTsc course. IPTsc should be timed to give protection during the period of greatest malaria risk. Most trials provided IPTsc monthly or each term. In settings where PMC is being provided, IPTsc may need to be given at regular intervals throughout the year. In perennial transmission settings, the higher the transmission intensity, the greater the expected value of drugs with longer half-lives or more frequent dosing, which will increase the proportion of time-at-risk protected by IPTsc. If IPTsc cannot be maintained throughout the year in perennial transmission settings due to resource constraints, IPTsc may be timed to provide protection during transmission peaks.\nDelivery: IPTsc can be delivered either through schools or through community-based approaches. The method of delivery should consider the local epidemiology of malaria and whether school-based delivery will offer protection during the period of greatest malaria risk. All types of schools that cater to children aged up to 15 years in the target area should be included for IPTsc delivery. National malaria programmes may be able to work with existing health programmes targeting school-aged children to facilitate delivery of IPTsc. Children not attending school are likely to be at highest risk of malaria and, if school attendance is not high, special efforts may be needed to target children not attending school. In seasonal transmission areas, delivery in schools may not align with peak malaria transmission and thus it may be more appropriate to utilize existing community-based approaches to reach school-aged children, such as those strategies used for SMC. Care is needed to ensure adequate communication with communities, teachers, caregivers and children to maximize understanding and acceptability in these key stakeholder groups. If older age groups are included in IPTsc administration, communication with key stakeholders should pay attention to the inclusion of girls of reproductive age (see ‘Age group’ above).\nDrug resistance: The impact of drug resistance on the protection provided by IPTsc is currently unclear. A re-analysis of data on resistance markers following monthly IPTsc found no suggestion of an increased prevalence of any resistance markers following DHAP administration (Plowe unpublished evidence). A review of the relationship between the different chemoprevention strategies (IPTp, PMC, SMC, MDA, IPTsc) and drug resistance concluded that malaria chemoprevention as used to date does not inevitably lead to an increase in resistance, and even high rates of resistance may not necessarily impair chemoprevention efficacy (Plowe unpublished evidence). However, expanded use of antimalarial medicines may increase resistance and eventually undermine efficacy. Using different drugs for chemoprevention and treatment, and combining drugs with counteracting resistance mechanisms may help to preserve efficacy (Plowe unpublished evidence).\nContraindications: IPTsc is not recommended for individuals receiving other forms of malaria chemoprevention (e.g. SMC or MDA). Children with sickle cell disease should be included in IPTsc unless they already receive regular chemoprevention due to sickle cell disease. Co-delivery of IPTsc alongside other school health programmes should consider drug manufacturers’ guidance regarding whether IPTsc can be safely given with other medicines and whether there are any additional contraindications as a result. Additionally, there is a need to consider how to include girls of reproductive age who should not be given certain antimalarials for prophylaxis without first confirming that they are not pregnant (see 'Age group' above for further information). IPTsc is not recommended in children with severe acute illness, those unable to take oral medication, children who during the last 30 days received a dose of any drug being used for IPTsc, or those allergic to any of the drugs being used for IPTsc. IPTsc-SP should not be given to individuals receiving a sulfa-based medication as treatment or prophylaxis, including co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole) for HIV.\nOther considerations: Information about IPTsc should be fully accessible to school-aged children, their caregivers and key stakeholders, such as teachers. As with all health interventions, consent should be obtained from the caregiver on behalf of the child prior to administration of IPTsc and, depending on age, from the child themselves.\nEvidence to decision (Benefits and harms): Clinical malaria: IPTsc may reduce clinical malaria during follow-up (adjusted relative risk: 0.5; low-certainty evidence). Anaemia: IPTsc may reduce anaemia (adjusted relative risk: 0.85; low-certainty evidence). Parasite prevalence: IPTsc may reduce P. falciparum parasite prevalence (adjusted relative risk: 0.46; low-certainty evidence). Adverse events: Eleven studies reported adverse events. No deaths were attributed to study drugs. Three studies reported more adverse events in the intervention group.",

No deaths were attributed to study drugs. Three studies reported more adverse events in the intervention group [142][143][144]. The most common adverse events were dizziness, nausea and vomiting shortly after treatment. One (IPTsc with SP+AQ in 6758 students) of the three studies [142] reported 23 serious adverse events (SAEs) – 19 in the IPTsc arm, of which three were judged to be drug-related. The most common serious adverse events were problems with balance, dizziness, feeling faint, nausea or vomiting. Another study with 794 participants reported no SAEs [143], but adverse events included headache, cough, abdominal pain, coryza, skin rash, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. SP+AQ was associated with more adverse events and more vomiting in the first three days compared to placebo. There were no differences in cumulative adverse events between arms by day 42. Among 404 children who received IPTsc with either SP or SP + piperaquine compared to control [144], no deaths or SAEs were reported. There was no difference in the proportion of children with adverse events, comparing SP to control; however, there were more children with dizziness in the SP + piperaquine arm compared to control.\nNone of the studies that met the inclusion criteria for the review systematically collected data on school attendance, severe malaria, hospital admissions (all-cause and malaria-specific), or mortality (all-cause and malaria-specific)2.\nMore information on the evidence can be found in the systematic review [145].\n1 Adjusted for age, sex and transmission intensity.\n2 School achievement was not ranked by the GDG as a critical outcome and therefore was not considered. However, the systematic review found a marginal effect of IPTsc on cognitive function in children 10–15 years (adjusted mean difference in standardized test scores: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.01–0.71; p-value for interaction = 0.004), but no significant effect was identified when data were combined across all ages (adjusted relative risk*: 0.12; 95% CI: -0.20–0.43; p = 0.4564).\nLow Certainty of the evidence\nThe evidence for all the critical outcomes was of low certainty because of serious risk of bias and inconsistency between the studies included in the review. Therefore, the GDG considered the overall certainty of the evidence for the outcomes of interest to be low.\nMore information on the certainty of evidence assessments can be found in the ‘research evidence’ tab associated with this recommendation online or in the annex of the pdf version.\nValues and preferences\nPreferences and values of the target population were determined by:\n• consultation with civil society, which indicated that chemoprevention to prevent malaria disease in children was seen as important in endemic areas – although children under 5 years old were mentioned as the particular priority (CS4ME unpublished evidence);\n• a synthesis of contextual factors from trials and pilots of IPTsc in sub-Saharan Africa, which found very little data on values and preferences (Gutman et al unpublished evidence (b)). In one study, parents considered chemoprevention to be useful and recommended that chemoprevention be expanded to include older children and even adults [146].\nThe GDG determined that there was probably no important uncertainty or variability in how the outcomes of IPTsc are valued across contexts.\nMore information can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Gutman et al unpublished evidence (b)) and the civil society consultation report (CS4ME unpublished evidence).\nResources\nThere are relatively few data on the cost of IPTsc. Key cost drivers were human resources (the provision of training to teachers) and the drug used, with intervention costs varying substantially based on the selected regimen. In Mali, the cost of delivering one course of SP+AS was US$ 2.72 per child, which decreased to US$ 1.00 per child for SP+AQ [147]. Modelling of IPTsc costs in Kenya estimated the intervention cost to be US$ 1.88 per child treated per year, with US$ 0.25 per child in set-up costs and US$ 1.63 per child in recurrent costs.\nThe modelled cost-effectiveness of IPTsc in Kenya was US$ 5.36 per P. falciparum infection averted and US$ 29.84 per case of anaemia averted [148]. The largest drivers of cost-effectiveness were the effectiveness of the intervention and the prevalence of anaemia.\nThe GDG determined that the resources required to implement IPTsc varied, and the certainty of the evidence on the resources required was low. The GDG concluded that IPTsc is probably a cost-effective intervention, and if existing health interventions are being delivered through schools, integrating IPTsc could yield some cost savings. The overall effectiveness of IPTsc is likely to be influenced by the local malaria epidemiology and age burden of disease: if school children are at high risk during the school term, then the cost-effectiveness of IPTsc is likely to increase.\nMore information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Gutman et al unpublished evidence (b)).\nEquity\nThere is very limited data on how a school-based platform for delivery of malaria chemoprevention to children would affect equity and health equality.\nThe GDG considered the equity of IPTsc to vary, depending on the proportion of children attending school. As those absent from school are more likely to be from lower socioeconomic groups and female,\nJustification\nThis recommendation was developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework [127].\nSources of information\nRecommendation development was informed by a systematic review [150], independently evaluated using the AMSTAR-2 Checklist (Gutman et al unpublished evidence (c))[139], and a report summarizing evidence from published studies on contextual factors related to IPTsc implementation (Gutman et al unpublished evidence (b)), including cost-effectiveness, feasibility, equity, values and acceptability. These sources of information were supplemented by a cross-cutting review on chemoprevention and drug resistance (Plowe unpublished evidence), a civil society consultation report on chemoprevention (CS4ME unpublished evidence) and contributions from the GDG membership, which included former and current national malaria programme representatives.\nThe systematic review addressed the GDG’s PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) question regarding whether school-aged children living in settings with malaria transmission should be given antimalarial medicines as chemoprevention to reduce disease burden. The main outcome of interest was the impact of IPTsc on confirmed clinical malaria. Other outcomes of interest included anaemia, school attendance, parasite prevalence, severe malaria, hospital admissions (all-cause and malaria-specific), adverse events, and mortality (all-cause and malaria-specific).

Other outcomes of interest included anaemia, school attendance, parasite prevalence, severe malaria, hospital admissions (all-cause and malaria-specific), adverse events, and mortality (all-cause and malaria-specific). Thirteen randomized trials were included in the review, 11 of which contributed data to an individual participant data meta-analysis. All the trials were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa: Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Senegal and Uganda. Drug regimens evaluated in the individual studies included DHAP in three trials, SP in three trials, SP+AQ in three trials, SP+AS in two trials, SP with piperaquine in one trial, AL in two trials, AS+AQ in two trials, doxycycline in one trial, primaquine in one trial, mefloquine plus multivitamin in one trial, and proguanil plus chloroquine in one trial. The systematic review grouped the treatment regimens by drug class and pharmacokinetic features: SP alone, SP combined with an aminoquinoline (either AQ or piperaquine), SP+AS, artemisinin-based combination therapy including an aminoquinoline (AS+AQ or DHAP), and AL. Treatment intervals ranged from daily (with subtherapeutic doses of primaquine and doxycycline) to every four months, with the majority of studies providing IPTsc monthly or each term (i.e. 3-4 month intervals). The systematic review included trials that studied IPTsc in children aged 5 to 15 years old, with the follow-up period ranging from six to 103 weeks and most studies delivering 1–12 courses of antimalarial treatment. The authors of the review estimated the proportion of the follow-up period protected by treatment for each of the individual studies, and this ranged from 2% to 100%. The AMSTAR-2 Checklist assessment concluded that the systematic review was of sufficient quality, and the inclusion of one new study identified since the systematic review was published did not substantially change the conclusions (Gutman et al unpublished evidence (c)). Four outcomes of interest to the GDG were not covered by the systematic review, namely school attendance, severe malaria, hospital admissions (all-cause and malaria-specific) and mortality (all-cause and malaria-specific). delivering IPTsc solely through schools may affect the equity of the strategy. There is some evidence that the effect of IPTsc on school performance may differ between girls and boys [149]. More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Gutman et al unpublished evidence (b)). Acceptability Few studies directly assessed the acceptability of IPTsc. Community sensitization was identified as important for improving the acceptability of IPTsc. In one study, 93% of children reported that they would be willing or very willing to take the tablets for IPTsc each school term [143]. Another study, which evaluated IPTsc among other interventions (iron fortification and anthelmintics), delivered two rounds of IPTsc-SP three months apart. Only one person (0.15%) approached for enrolment refused to participate, and there was high compliance (93.7%) among those who participated, suggesting that treatment was acceptable [150]. In a study that added malaria treatment to an existing school-based MDA programme, 87% of children received IPTsc, suggesting that it might be acceptable to combine the intervention with ongoing health programmes [151]. In another study, staff noted issues with acceptance from parents, particularly when there were side effects from the drugs. Consequently, parents would refuse the second and third days of treatment, and acceptance was lower with subsequent rounds [146]. The GDG considered IPTsc to probably be acceptable to key stakeholders. More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Gutman et al unpublished evidence (b)). Feasibility The feasibility of IPTsc is influenced by the choice of drug regimen. One study suggested that using a simpler antimalarial regimen would enhance compliance, as single-dose regimens could be administered as DOT. Additionally, feasibility may be adversely impacted in girls of reproductive age, given the need to confirm that they are not pregnant before giving certain antimalarials as IPTsc [152]. Poor uptake of IPTsc in one study was attributed to poor community perceptions about IPTsc and the requirement for parental informed consent [152]. School-based delivery is likely to be more feasible than community-based delivery of IPTsc, but enrolment rates and absenteeism could pose barriers to reaching children through schools [152]. In some countries, schools already provide nutrition services and are sites of targeted insecticide-treated net (ITN) distribution and deworming programmes (Gutman et al unpublished evidence (b)). The GDG considered IPTsc implementation to probably be feasible. More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Gutman et al unpublished evidence (b)). Summary of judgements The Evidence-to-Decision framework captures the evidence from the systematic review considered by the GDG. The GDG considered the balance between desirable and undesirable effects to probably favour IPTsc; costs associated with IPTsc implementation to vary; and the certainty of the evidence on resources required to be low. In addition, IPTsc was considered probably cost-effective; the equity of IPTsc was judged to vary, depending on the proportion of children attending school; and IPTsc was judged as probably acceptable to key stakeholders and probably feasible to implement. The GDG concluded that a conditional recommendation should be made for IPTsc for school-aged children in moderate to high burden malaria transmission settings given IPTsc’s moderate beneficial effects and small undesirable effects. Implementation A guide to support implementation of IPTsc will be developed in due course, and a manual for subnational tailoring of malaria interventions is under development. Evaluation The safety and impact of IPTsc programmes should be routinely monitored. The effect of introducing IPTsc may be evaluated using routine hospital, clinic and/or community health worker data. School surveys provide an opportunity to evaluate outcomes related to school attendance and achievement. The WHO chemoprevention efficacy study (CPES) protocol should be used to monitor the efficacy of medicines used for chemoprevention. Although the potential effect of chemoprevention on the spread of drug resistance may be monitored by the analysis of molecular markers associated with treatment outcomes, the correlation between molecular markers and the efficacy of antimalarials for chemoprevention is unclear and results should be interpreted with caution. Research needs The GDG highlighted the following evidence gaps requiring further research. These relate to: the efficacy of alternative (e.g. monthly versus each term) IPTsc drug regimens at different transmission intensities; the value of IPTsc in children 10 years and under compared to the value in children over 10 years old; the full economic and financial costs (including the cost of engaging communities, parents, school teachers, etc.) of introduction and deployment of IPTsc.",

Post-discharge malaria chemoprevention (PDMC) is the administration of a full antimalarial treatment course at regular intervals to children admitted with severe anaemia. The purpose of PDMC is to prevent new malaria infections in children admitted with severe anaemia during the period after hospital discharge when they are at high risk of re-admission or death. Severe anaemia is defined by WHO’s Haemoglobin concentrations for the diagnosis of anaemia and assessment of severity [153]. The aetiology of severe anaemia is multifactorial and it is often difficult to identify the main cause of any episode of severe anaemia without further laboratory tests, including a complete blood cell count. PDMC should be given even when the cause(s) of severe anaemia in an individual cannot be identified. Practical info: Antimalarial medicine. Medicines used for PDMC can be the same as the first-line malaria treatment, but an alternative medicine is preferred. SP, AL and DHAP were used in three trials and all regimens were found to be effective for PDMC (Phiri et al unpublished evidence). Age group. Local data on the age distribution of severe anaemia should be referenced when determining the target age group for PDMC. Two studies evaluated PDMC doses in children under 59 months [154][155], and one study evaluated doses in children aged 3 months to 9 years [156]. Dosage. Children on PDMC should receive a complete course of antimalarials at the recommended treatment dose. The drug dosage should be determined by the child’s weight wherever possible, with dosing according to age only in situations where the child’s weight is unknown or cannot be determined. Frequency. The frequency of PDMC administration should be informed by the length of protective efficacy of the selected drug, the duration of the transmission season, and the feasibility of delivering each additional PDMC treatment. Two of the three trials providing evidence for this recommendation provided three PDMC treatments. One trial administered SP monthly starting seven days post-discharge until the end of the transmission season [156]; another trial administered AL at discharge then twice at four and eight weeks post-discharge [154]; and the third trial administered AL at discharge and then DHAP three times starting 14 days post-discharge and then monthly [155]. Delivery. Two delivery approaches for PDMC were evaluated in one effectiveness study: community-based and facility-based delivery strategies. For community-based delivery, caregivers received all courses of PDMC on discharge, whereas for facility-based delivery, the caregiver had to collect the PDMC drugs from a health facility each month. Community-based delivery was preferred by caregivers and associated with increased adherence compared to facility-based strategies (community:70.6% vs. facility: 52.0%, p = 0.006) [157]. Caregivers felt that the instructions on PDMC administration written on the child’s health card were sufficient without reminders via text message or from community health workers (CHWs). There was no statistical evidence that SMS reminders resulted in greater adherence (incidence rate ratio: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.88–1.21; p = 0.68) [158]. Drug resistance. The impact of drug resistance on the protection provided by PDMC is currently unclear. A relatively small proportion of the population is eligible for PDMC compared to other malaria chemoprevention interventions such as SMC, PMC or IPTp. Hence, the selective pressure exerted by PDMC on the parasite population, and consequent risk of PDMC increasing resistance to antimalarials across the population, is likely to be small. Conditional recommendation for, Moderate certainty evidence. Post-discharge malaria chemoprevention (2022). Children admitted to hospital with severe anaemia living in settings with moderate to high malaria transmission can be given a full therapeutic course of an antimalarial medicine at predetermined times following discharge from hospital to reduce re-admission and death. • Post-discharge malaria chemoprevention (PDMC) should be given to children following admission with severe anaemia [153] that is not due to blood loss following trauma, surgery, malignancy or a bleeding disorder. • PDMC implementation should be tailored to admissions of children with severe anaemia and consider the duration of protection of the selected antimalarial, and the feasibility and affordability of delivering each additional PDMC course (see “Practical info”). • Moderate to high perennial malaria transmission settings are defined as areas with a P. falciparum parasite prevalence greater than 10% or an annual parasite incidence greater than 250 per 1000 [30]. These thresholds are indicative and should not be regarded as absolute for determining applicability of the PDMC recommendation. Contraindications. Individuals should not receive both PDMC and other forms of malaria chemoprevention (e.g. SMC, PMC or MDA). If other malaria chemoprevention programmes are unable to effectively screen and exclude individuals receiving PDMC, then PDMC should not be administered during periods when SMC, PMC or MDA are being provided. Children with sickle cell disease should be included in PDMC, unless they are already receiving regular chemoprevention due to sickle cell disease. PDMC is not recommended in children who develop severe acute illness following discharge, those who are unable to take oral medication, children who during the last 30 days received a dose of any of the drugs being used for PDMC, or those allergic to any of the drugs being used for PDMC. PDMC-SP should not be given to individuals receiving a sulfa-based medication as treatment or prophylaxis, including co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole) for HIV. Other considerations. Information about PDMC should be fully accessible to caregivers. As with all health interventions, consent should be obtained from the caregiver on behalf of the child prior to administration of PDMC. Evidence to decision. Benefits and harms Study outcomes were considered during the period of intervention and in the period immediately following",

    "content": "Other considerations: Information about PDMC should be fully accessible to caregivers. As with all health interventions, consent should be obtained from the caregiver on behalf of the child prior to administration of PDMC. Evidence to decision: Benefits and harms. Study outcomes were considered during the period of intervention and in the period immediately following the intervention. The intervention period began at the first dose of the first course of PDMC and ended four weeks after the first dose of the last course of PDMC. The post-intervention period began on the day after completion of the intervention period and continued for up to 26 weeks (six months).\n• Re-admission (all-cause and severe anaemia): PDMC probably reduces all-cause re-admission during the intervention period (risk ratio: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.34–0.52; moderate-certainty evidence). In the post-intervention period, the effect of PDMC varies and may result in little to no difference in all-cause re-admission (hazard ratio: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.83–1.30; moderate-certainty evidence). PDMC probably reduces re-admission for severe anaemia during the intervention period (hazard ratio: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.26–0.56; moderate-certainty evidence) and during the post-intervention period (hazard ratio: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.52–1.05; moderate-certainty evidence). PDMC probably reduces re-admission for severe malaria during the intervention period (hazard ratio: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.22–0.48; moderate-certainty evidence), but may have little effect during the post-intervention period (hazard ratio: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.81–1.39; moderate-certainty evidence).\n• Death (all-cause): PDMC reduces all-cause mortality during the intervention period (risk ratio: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.08–0.70; high-certainty evidence). The effect in the post-intervention period varies and may result in little or no difference in all-cause mortality (risk ratio: 1.61; 95% CI: 0.81–3.19; moderate-certainty evidence). Overall, PDMC probably reduces all-cause mortality (risk ratio: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.47–1.28; moderate-certainty evidence).\n• Clinical malaria: PDMC probably reduces clinical malaria (hazard ratio: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.58–0.72; moderate-certainty evidence), with most of the benefit accruing during the intervention period (hazard ratio: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.36–0.50; versus 0.96; 95% CI: 0.83–1.11 during the post-intervention period; both moderate-certainty evidence).\n• Adverse events: The three randomized controlled studies provided moderate-certainty evidence on adverse events associated with using different antimalarials: SP, AL, and DHAP. Minor symptoms recorded for those in the SP arm 30 days after the administration of each treatment were similar to those seen in the placebo arm [156]. DHAP administration was associated with vomiting within 60 minutes after drug intake (12.4%, compared to placebo 3.8%) [155]. No drug-related serious adverse events were reported in the study arm receiving monthly AL [154]. DHAP was associated with an 18.6 ms (95% CI: 15.6–21.8; moderate-certainty evidence) increase of the QTc interval (Fridericia correction) after the third dose of each course. All events of QTc interval prolongation were asymptomatic and none of the children in the DHAP group had QTc interval values of more than 500 ms (Fridericia-corrected). No information was provided in the systematic review on severe malaria, anaemia or severe anaemia not associated with re-admission, blood transfusion or parasite prevalence outcomes. More information on the evidence can be found in the systematic review (Phiri et al unpublished evidence).\n\nModerate Certainty of the evidence: The certainty of the evidence across all critical outcomes ranged from moderate to high. Only the evidence on the effect of PDMC on all-cause mortality during the 2–14-week intervention period was of high certainty. The GDG consequently considered the certainty of the evidence overall to be moderate. More information on the certainty of evidence assessments can be found in the ‘research evidence’ tab associated with this recommendation online or in the annex of the pdf version.\n\nValues and preferences: Preferences and values of the target population were determined by: • consultation with civil society, which indicated that chemoprevention to prevent malaria disease in children under 5 years was seen as a priority in endemic areas, although there was no specific mention of the need during the post-discharge period (CS4ME unpublished evidence); • a synthesis of contextual factors from trials of PDMC in sub-Saharan Africa (Lange et al unpublished evidence). The report showed that caregivers had generally positive views of PDMC. Caregivers understood the value of giving preventive malaria medicines during the post-discharge period, given that their children had recently been in hospital [159]. CHWs also viewed PDMC as an important and beneficial intervention [157]. The GDG determined that there was probably no important uncertainty or variability in how the outcomes of PDMC are valued across contexts. More information can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Lange et al unpublished evidence) and the civil society consultation report (CS4ME unpublished evidence).\n\nResources: The mean estimated cost of implementing community-based PDMC was between US$ 22.91 and US$ 28.33 per child treated in the three countries where the studies were conducted. Implementation costs for community-based PDMC were outweighed by cost savings for re-admission compared to standard care, with a mean expected saving per child between US$ 22.08 and US$ 45.24. Health care providers’ net cost saving per child receiving PDMC, including health care (especially blood transfusion) and societal costs, was between US$ 19.12 and US$ 25.71. Two approaches for delivering PDMC were evaluated: (i) facility-based, in which children had to be brought to a health facility to receive subsequent doses of PDMC, and (ii) community-based, in which the caregiver received all doses for PDMC on discharge with instructions and dates for administration written on the child’s health card, and with CHWs reminding caregivers when to administer doses, SMS reminders, or no reminders. Community-delivered PDMC was found to be more cost-saving compared to health facility-based delivery due to costs from repeated travel for drug collection, which also posed a disincentive to adherence. The GDG judged that PDMC probably results in moderate savings and is therefore probably cost-effective, but the certainty of the evidence regarding the resources required was low. More information on the evidence can be found in the report on PDMC cost-effectiveness (Kühl et al unpublished evidence).\n\nEquity: None of the studies included in the PDMC contextual factors report were designed to capture issues related to equity. However, caregivers whose children received PDMC from the health facility reported that repeated travel to the hospital to collect medicines was costly and time-consuming. Caregiver literacy was identified as a potential challenge for equitable PDMC delivery among participants who received all medicines when their child was discharged (community-based delivery), as some caregivers may not be able to read.

    "content": "was identified as a potential challenge for equitable PDMC delivery among participants who received all medicines when their child was discharged (community-based delivery), as some caregivers may not be able to read the PDMC administration dates recorded on their child’s health card. SMS reminders (see “Feasibility” below) may also raise concerns over equity. The GDG considered that PDMC has a variable effect on health equity and noted that PDMC likely reinforces existing health inequities, given that it is administered to children who have already accessed a hospital. Nevertheless, among those who have already accessed a hospital, the intervention is likely to be equitable; however, this may be dependent on how PDMC is administered, with community-based delivery being potentially more equitable than facility-based delivery. More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Lange et al unpublished evidence).\nJustification: This recommendation was developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework [122].\nSources of information: Recommendation development was informed by a systematic review (Phiri et al unpublished evidence), independently evaluated using the AMSTAR-2 Checklist [134] (Gutman et al unpublished evidence (d)), and a report summarizing evidence from published studies on contextual factors related to PDMC implementation (Lange et al unpublished evidence), including feasibility, equity, values and acceptability, as well as a cost-effectiveness analysis (Kühl et al unpublished evidence). These sources of information were supplemented by a cross-cutting review on chemoprevention and drug resistance (Plowe unpublished evidence), a civil society consultation report on chemoprevention (CS4ME unpublished evidence) and contributions from the GDG membership, which included former and current national malaria programme representatives. The systematic review addressed the GDG’s PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) question regarding whether children hospitalized with severe anaemia in malaria-endemic settings should be given antimalarial medicines as chemoprevention post-discharge. The main outcomes of interest were the impact of PDMC on re-admission (all-cause and severe anaemia), mortality (all-cause), severe anaemia, and blood transfusion. Other outcomes of interest included confirmed clinical malaria, severe malaria, anaemia, adverse events, and parasite prevalence. Three randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials were included in the review. All the trials were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa: Gambia, Kenya, Malawi and Uganda. One trial evaluated monthly SP until the end of the malaria transmission season; another trial evaluated monthly AL at four and eight weeks post-discharge; and the third trial evaluated monthly DHAP at 14, 42 and 70 days post-discharge. The systematic review included trials that compared PDMC with no intervention in children aged < 9 years with anaemia, defined as haemoglobin < 7 g/dL (one trial), or severe anaemia, defined as haemoglobin < 5 g/dL. The intervention period started from the first dose of the first course of PDMC and continued until four weeks after the first dose of the last course of PDMC, a follow-up period of 2–14 weeks. The post-intervention period started the day after the completion of the intervention period and continued up to 26 weeks. The AMSTAR-2 Checklist assessment concluded that the systematic review was good quality overall (Gutman et al unpublished evidence (d)). Five outcomes of interest were not covered by the systematic review, namely severe malaria, anaemia, severe anaemia, blood transfusion and parasite prevalence.\nAcceptability: One study showed that community-based PDMC resulted in higher self-reported adherence than facility-based PDMC (71% vs 52% adherence to the full three courses). Community-based adherence may have been influenced by the anticipation of study staff visits for pill counts after each treatment course. Potential stigma from repeated CHW visits may be a potential issue for community-based adherence. The GDG considered PDMC to probably be acceptable to key stakeholders. More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Lange et al unpublished evidence).\nFeasibility: For community-based delivery of PDMC, CHWs reported a high level of intrinsic motivation to conduct home visits to remind caregivers to administer PDMC doses. Nevertheless, adherence to the required number of home visits was poor, with less than half of the CHWs conducting the required home visit reminders. Positive factors that encouraged CHWs to conduct home visits were the knowledge and perception of PDMC effectiveness, and recognition from the community and the health system. Reported barriers to CHWs conducting home visits included poor training, lack of supervision, and high workload. Written reminders of PDMC treatment dates on children’s health cards were positively viewed by participants. Most caregivers preferred SMS reminders over CHW visits, but those who didn’t own a phone had to receive reminders through neighbours and/or family members, which caused delays. Although PDMC adherence was higher among SMS recipients (66.2%) compared to non-SMS participants (56.9%), there was no statistical evidence that SMS reminders resulted in greater adherence (incidence rate ratio: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.88–1.21; p = 0.68). The GDG concluded that it was unclear whether PDMC implementation was broadly feasible, given that there is currently only evidence from three trials, including one implementation study. The optimal approach to PDMC implementation may vary in different places and, where CHWs are involved, may benefit from a direct link between health facilities and community-based care. More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Lange et al unpublished evidence).\nSummary of judgements: The Evidence-to-Decision framework captures the evidence from the systematic review considered by the GDG. The GDG determined that the balance between desirable and undesirable effects favoured PDMC; moderate cost savings were probably associated with PDMC implementation; PDMC is therefore probably cost-effective, although the certainty of evidence regarding required resources was low; and PDMC is probably acceptable to key stakeholders, but the feasibility of implementing PDMC at scale is not known. The GDG concluded that a conditional recommendation should be made for PDMC based on the moderate- to high-certainty evidence of large beneficial effects and likely low costs.\nImplementation: A guide to support implementation of PDMC will be developed in due course, and a manual for subnational tailoring of malaria interventions is under development.\nEvaluation: PDMC programmes should be routinely monitored for safety, efficacy, drug resistance and effectiveness. The impact of introducing PDMC may be evaluated using routine hospital, clinic and/or CHW data. The potential effect of PDMC on the spread of drug resistance is likely to be modest, given the small proportion of the population.",

Further guidance will be made available in the PDMC implementation guide, which will be developed in due course. Research needs The GDG identified the following evidence gaps as requiring further research. These relate to: • the optimal duration for PDMC in different geographical and transmission settings, and understanding of the short-, medium- and long-term benefits of PDMC of different durations; these evaluations should recognize the underlying pattern of post-discharge death and/or re-admission, and the higher risk of some groups dying soon after discharge; to minimize bias, the overall impact during the whole intervention and follow-up period should be considered; • a better understanding of risk factors (including age) for adverse outcomes following discharge with severe anaemia, and potential differential effects of PDMC in different risk groups; • patient adherence to PDMC when deployed at scale; • costs of and coverage achieved by alternative approaches to delivering PDMC; • feasibility of different coordination mechanisms between hospital and outpatient/community settings for PDMC; • feasibility of implementing PDMC in parallel with other malaria chemoprevention interventions (e.g. SMC and PMC); • the long-term (e.g. 12 months and longer) impact of PDMC on child survival; • the effectiveness of PDMC on severe anaemia of different etiologies; • the effectiveness of PDMC for children diagnosed with severe anaemia and malaria in low transmission settings; • the feasibility, costs and effects of combining PDMC with additional interventions (e.g. ITNs) to reduce the household’s risk of further infection and adverse health outcomes. 4.2.6 Mass drug administration (MDA) Mass drug administration (MDA) for malaria is the administration of a full therapeutic course of an antimalarial medicine at approximately the same time, and often at repeated intervals, to all age groups of a population in a defined geographical area. Antimalarial medicines are administered without prior malaria testing and therefore regardless of the malaria infection status of individuals. Consequently, any existing infections are treated and new infections are prevented for the duration of the drug’s prophylactic period. MDA has been an important component of malaria control and elimination programmes for decades [160]. Some earlier WHO documents referred to “age-targeted MDA”: however, such use cases are no longer considered MDA and recommendations for such targeted use are presented separately – see recommendations for perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC) (section 4.2.2) and seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) (section 4.2.3). The use of chemoprevention in occupationally vulnerable groups, such as forest workers, is considered targeted drug administration (TDA) and not MDA. Similarly, use of chemoprevention around a confirmed case in areas approaching elimination or post-elimination preventing re-establishment is known as reactive drug administration (RDA). Although not called MDA, all of these strategies share a common underlying principle – that the provision of a treatment dose of antimalarial medicine will cure existing infections and prevent new ones. Historically, MDA has been given either to reduce malaria disease burden or to reduce malaria transmission. The distinction between the two MDA use cases for P. falciparum is to some extent artificial, as any intervention that reduces transmission will also reduce disease burden, and burden-reducing interventions that reach a sufficient proportion of the population will also reduce transmission. Nevertheless, the evidence on the use of MDA for disease burden and transmission reduction was considered separately by two Guideline Development Groups (GDGs). The two GDGs broadly recommended that programmes may consider MDA to reduce P. falciparum transmission in very low to low transmission settings, and to reduce disease burden in moderate to high transmission settings. A P. falciparum prevalence (PfPR2-10) of around 10% (or incidence of infection around 250 per 1000 population per year) may be used to differentiate areas of low to very low transmission from areas of moderate to high transmission. These thresholds should not be considered absolute cut-offs and it is biologically plausible that MDA in settings near the 10% threshold may reduce both disease burden and transmission intensity. However, the relative effects of burden reduction versus transmission reduction differ along the transmission spectrum. Malaria programmes should therefore review the MDA recommendations and practical information for both burden and transmission reduction and decide whether or not an MDA intervention is likely to lead to a successful outcome in their setting. The use of MDA for P. vivax is more complicated, as P. vivax infections may relapse within a few months unless treated with an antimalarial medicine that includes an 8-aminoquinoline to clear hypnozoites. An 8-aminoquinoline medicine has the potential to cause severe haemolysis in persons deficient for the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme. Safe administration of an 8-aminoquinoline requires G6PD testing, an effective pharmacovigilance system and emergency access to blood transfusion services. The two GDGs that reviewed evidence for the impact of MDA on P. vivax prioritized different outcome measures and arrived at different recommendations. Whereas the evidence was considered insufficient to recommend MDA for the reduction of P. vivax disease, it was recognized that, in some situations, MDA may usefully contribute to the reduction of P. vivax transmission. Malaria programmes should, therefore, review the MDA recommendations for P. vivax and decide whether or not an MDA intervention is likely to lead to a successful outcome in their setting. A chemoprevention strategy related to MDA that is intended to reduce transmission of P. vivax is mass relapse prevention (MRP). MRP is similar to MDA in that the entire population of a delimited geographical area is provided with an antimalarial medicine at approximately the same time. In the case of MRP, however, only an 8-aminoquinoline drug is provided. In the past, the strategy used primaquine and was referred to as “mass primaquine prophylactic treatment”. However, the name of this strategy has since been expanded to include the potential for new drugs with similar anti-relapse properties. Generally deployed in areas with cold winters and highly seasonal transmission of P. vivax, the medicine is provided to the population in early spring, when there is no or",

However, the name of this strategy has since been expanded to include the potential for new drugs with similar anti-relapse properties. Generally deployed in areas with cold winters and highly seasonal transmission of P. vivax, the medicine is provided to the population in early spring, when there is no or very low transmission of the parasite, to treat hypnozoites and prevent relapses that could infect a new population of mosquitoes in the summer months. WHO recommends that malaria programmes tailor intervention packages to their local context. The MDA recommendations are subject to considerations, identified by the GDGs, which will influence the likelihood of successful outcomes. These contextual considerations are outlined in remarks under the recommendations and in the “Practical info” sections.\n• Recommendations regarding the use of MDA for burden reduction are presented in section 4.2.6.1 MDA for burden reduction; and recommendations for burden reduction in emergency settings are presented in section 4.2.6.2 MDA for burden reduction in emergency settings;\n• Recommendations for transmission reduction are found in section 4.2.6.3 MDA to reduce transmission of P. falciparum in very low to low transmission settings; section 4.2.6.4 MDA to reduce transmission of P. falciparum in moderate to high transmission settings; and section 4.2.6.5 MDA to reduce transmission of P. vivax.\n• The recommendation for MRP is found in section 4.2.6.6 MRP to reduce transmission of P. vivax.\n\n4.2.6.1 MDA for burden reduction\n\nPractical info\nTransmission setting\nThe impact of MDA on disease burden varies between high and low malaria transmission settings. In high transmission settings, the impact of MDA on disease is likely to be large and may be cost-effective due to the high background disease burden. However, as transmission intensity and the corresponding disease burden decrease, the impact of MDA also decreases and MDA becomes less cost-effective for disease burden reduction. The effect on other outcomes, parasite incidence and prevalence, and incidence of severe disease also appears to vary by transmission intensity. There are no studies directly comparing the impact of MDA for burden reduction with the impact of more targeted approaches to chemoprevention (e.g. SMC) (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (a)). MDA for burden reduction should be targeted at moderate to high transmission settings, regardless of seasonality.\n\nAntimalarial medicine\nWHO recommends the use of a combination medicine for MDA that is different from that used as first-line malaria treatment. The component medicines should have closely matched pharmacology, such that no component is present in the absence of other components for more than a minimal amount of time in order to reduce the risk of new infections encountering only a single drug. A drug regimen that can be administered as a directly observed single dose is preferable to a multi-day regimen. Data were insufficient to discern a specific effect of single-dose primaquine. Available evidence suggests that maximum benefits are seen within 1–3 months after the last round of the intervention (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (a)).\n\nDosage\nA complete therapeutic course of antimalarials, at doses recommended by the manufacturer, should be given to all eligible adults and children within a defined geographical area. Drug dosage should be determined by weight wherever possible, with dosing according to age only in situations where the person’s weight is unknown.\n\nFrequency\nThe frequency of MDA rounds should take into account the local malaria epidemiology, the half-life of the antimalarial used, and the feasibility and cost of delivering each additional round. Consistent with trial data, mathematical models predict that a single round of MDA would lead to an initial decrease in infections, but that the duration of effect would be short-lived. Application of additional rounds is predicted to substantially improve the impact and duration of effect. MDA should not be given to individuals receiving other forms of malaria chemoprevention (e.g. SMC, PMC, or IPTp) (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (a)).\n\nDrug resistance\nThere is limited evidence to date on whether MDA accelerates the development and spread of antimalarial drug resistance. However, where data were collected, MDA had little to no effect on drug resistance markers (PfKelch13 and Pfplasmepsin2/3 copy number) among P. falciparum infections (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (a); Plowe unpublished evidence).\n\nConditional recommendation for, Low certainty evidence\nMDA for burden reduction (2022)\nAntimalarial medicine can be given as chemoprevention through mass drug administration (MDA) in areas of moderate to high transmission of P. falciparum to provide short-term reductions in disease burden.\n• MDA may quickly reduce clinical malaria incidence in settings with moderate to high P. falciparum transmission, but the effect wanes within 1–3 months. Therefore, if MDA is implemented, it should be one of several components of a robust malaria control programme (including good coverage of effective case management and appropriate prevention tools and strategies).\n• Malaria programmes should judge the suitability of using MDA in their context based on the desired impact, level of endemicity, and resources required. MDA for burden reduction should be targeted at moderate to high transmission settings, regardless of seasonality (see “Practical info”).\n• Moderate to high malaria transmission settings are defined as areas with P. falciparum parasite prevalence greater than 10%, or incidence greater than 250 P. falciparum cases per 1000 population per year [30]. These thresholds should not be regarded as absolutes for determining applicability of MDA implementation. It is biologically plausible that MDA in intermediate transmission settings may reduce both disease burden and transmission intensity.\n\nContraindications\nDepending on the medicine chosen, certain population groups may need to be excluded from MDA. These include pregnant women in their first trimester; infants <6 months of age or weighing <5kg; people recently treated with the same medicine; people with a known allergy to the medicine; anyone with severe acute illness or who is unable to take oral medication; people taking medicine known to interact with the medicine used for MDA; and people with specific contraindications to the medicine used [161].\n\nOther considerations\nInformation about MDA should be fully accessible to caregivers, health workers and key stakeholders, such as government officials and religious leaders. As with all health interventions, consent should be obtained, including from the carers of children, prior to administration of MDA.\n\nEvidence to decision\nBenefits and harms Moderate to high transmission areas\n• Clinical malaria: MDA may reduce clinical malaria incidence 1–3 months post-MDA (rate ratio: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.04–4.42; low-certainty evidence).

There was limited evidence available on the effect on malaria burden 4–12 months post-MDA or 12–24 months post-MDA. • All-cause mortality: It is very uncertain whether MDA affects mortality within the first month post-MDA (risk ratio: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.57–0.81; very low-certainty evidence) or 1–3 months post-MDA (odds ratio: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.54–2.04; very low-certainty evidence). No evidence was available from randomized trials and the certainty of evidence from non-randomized trials was graded very low. • Parasitaemia: MDA probably reduces the incidence of P. falciparum infection 1–3 months post-MDA (rate ratio: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.40–0.92; moderate-certainty evidence), but may have little to no effect on incidence 4–12 months post-MDA as the evidence is very uncertain (rate ratio: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.55–1.50; very low-certainty evidence).

Evidence from non-randomized trials suggests: MDA may reduce parasite prevalence 12–24 months post-MDA (risk ratio: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.70–0.84; low-certainty evidence), 1–3 months post-MDA (risk ratio: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.78–0.93; very low-certainty evidence) and 4–12 months post-MDA (risk ratio: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.55–0.67; very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. • Adverse events: We are uncertain whether MDA increases or decreases adverse events 1–3 months post-MDA (odds ratio: 3.25; 95% CI: 0.68–15.53; very low-certainty evidence). No data were available to assess the effect of MDA on serious adverse events in moderate to high transmission settings, but the absolute risk is very low (0.01 per 1000 doses). • Anaemia, drug resistance, hospitalization, severe malaria, or blood transfusions: In the studies that met the inclusion criteria, none systematically collected data on these outcomes for moderate to high transmission areas, beyond what was reported as severe adverse events.

It is uncertain whether MDA reduces clinical malaria 4–12 months post-MDA, as the evidence is very uncertain (rate ratio: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.21–1.03; very low-certainty evidence). • Anaemia: MDA increases mean haemoglobin (mean difference: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.27–0.79; high-certainty evidence). • Parasitaemia: MDA probably reduces the incidence of P. falciparum infection 1–3 months post-MDA (rate ratio: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.21–0.66; moderate-certainty evidence). MDA may reduce P. falciparum prevalence 0–1 month post-MDA (risk ratio: 0.12; 95% CI: 0.03–0.52; moderate-certainty evidence) and probably reduces P. falciparum prevalence 1–3 months post-MDA (risk ratio: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.15–0.41; moderate-certainty evidence).

However, the absolute event rate is very low (0.03 per 1000). Four studies only presented narrative summaries of adverse events. No data were available to assess the effect of MDA on adverse events in very low to low transmission settings. • All-cause mortality, hospitalization, severe malaria, or blood transfusions: In the studies that met the inclusion criteria, none systematically collected data on these outcomes for very low to low transmission areas, beyond what was reported as severe adverse events.

Non-randomized trials showed that MDA may reduce the incidence of P. vivax malaria at <1 month (rate ratio: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.21–0.25; very low-certainty evidence), 1–3 months (rate ratio: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.26–0.31; very low-certainty evidence), 4–12 months (rate ratio: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.68–0.76; very low-certainty evidence) or 12–24 months post-MDA (rate ratio: 0.04; 95% CI: 0.02–0.07; very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. • Parasitaemia: MDA probably reduces P. vivax prevalence 0–1 month post-MDA (risk ratio: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.08–0.40; moderate-certainty evidence), and may reduce P. vivax prevalence 1–3 months (risk ratio: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.10–0.24; low-certainty evidence) and 12–24 months post-MDA (risk ratio: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.44–1.48; low-certainty evidence). However, MDA may result in little or no difference 4–12 months post-MDA (risk ratio: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.87–1.18; low-certainty evidence). Evidence from non-randomized trials for incidence of P. vivax infection show that MDA may reduce incidence <1 month after MDA (rate ratio: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.12–0.19; low-certainty evidence). MDA may reduce P. vivax incidence at 1–3 months (rate ratio: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.32–0.43; very low-certainty evidence) and 4–12 months post-MDA (rate ratio: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.07–0.34; very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. • Adverse events: With the drugs used in the studies included in the review, MDA probably increases the frequency of serious adverse events post-MDA (0–3 months post-MDA: odds ratio: 3.61; 95% CI: 0.43–30.03; moderate-certainty evidence; 4–12 months post-MDA: odds ratio: 1.47; 95% CI: 0.68–3.20; moderate-certainty evidence). • Anaemia, all-cause mortality, drug resistance, hospitalization, severe malaria, or blood transfusions: In the studies that met the inclusion criteria, none systematically collected data on these outcomes for P. vivax transmission areas, beyond what was reported as severe adverse events.

    "content": "Low Certainty of the evidence\nThe GDG considered the overall certainty of the evidence for the outcomes of interest to be low. The certainty of evidence, as summarized under “Benefits and harms”, ranged from very low to high. The priority outcome of confirmed clinical malaria was assessed as having predominantly low-certainty evidence for P. falciparum transmission settings and very low-certainty evidence for P. vivax transmission settings. Most studies reported on outcomes after the last round of MDA, rather than during the intervention period. Studies with multiple rounds of MDA may not have captured important effects that occurred between the first and last rounds of MDA, and outcomes may reflect a cumulative effect for MDA. There is a lack of evidence on clinical outcomes during the 0–1 months post-intervention, when impact may be expected to be the greatest. There is no information on effectiveness if rounds of MDA continue for >1 year. More information on the certainty of evidence assessments can be found in the ‘research evidence’ tab associated with this recommendation online or in the annex of the pdf version.\nValues and preferences\nPreferences and values of the target population were determined by:\n• consultation with civil society, which indicated that chemoprevention to prevent malaria disease is broadly considered a priority, especially in children under 5 years and women in pregnancy;\n• synthesis of contextual factors from trials and pilots of MDA. One study that surveyed participants’ values found that the most common explanation for the uptake of MDA was the desire to protect their family or community from future malaria infections.\nThe GDG determined that there was possibly important uncertainty or variability in how the main outcomes are valued across contexts, dependent on the transmission setting and burden of disease. More information on the evidence can be found in the systematic review (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (a)) and the civil society consultation report (CS4ME unpublished evidence).\nResources\nThe estimated costs per person per round varied from approximately US$ 1.04 to US$ 19.40; one study estimated that drugs accounted for 70% of the cost of MDA (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (a)). The costs associated with MDA are likely to vary depending on the extent to which the intervention could leverage existing campaigns and platforms.\nModerate to high transmission areas\nData on the cost-effectiveness of MDA are sparse. However, the GDG judged that MDA is likely to be cost-effective in moderate to high transmission settings due to the greater number of cases averted in these settings.\nVery low to low transmission areas\nGiven that fewer malaria cases will be averted, the GDG judged MDA as probably not cost-effective for disease burden reduction in low transmission settings.\nMore information can be found in the systematic review (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (a)).\nEquity\nThere was no evidence of a direct impact of MDA on health equity, although the GDG judged that it would likely increase health equity by enhancing access to medicines for those at risk of malaria. Specific effort may be needed to reach high-risk communities, among whom uptake tends to be lower, and ethnic minority communities that may suffer geographical isolation. More information can be found in the systematic review (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (a)).\nAcceptability\nMDA is probably acceptable to key stakeholders. Studies have shown that sensitization, education, and inclusion of local leaders, such as government figures, religious leaders and health authorities, are very important in improving acceptability. The most common barrier to acceptability is fear of perceived adverse events. Two studies found that participants were concerned that adverse events may inhibit their economic productivity, although, in another study, respondents felt that malaria infection was more likely to limit their economic activity than adverse events. Previous experience reinforced initial perceptions of MDA: individuals who had been part of previous MDA trials shared stories in their communities; if those experiences were poor, community members reinforced initial perceptions of MDA.\nJustification\nThis recommendation was developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework [122].\nSources of information\nA systematic review of existing evidence was commissioned to inform this guidance on the use of MDA to reduce the burden of malaria disease (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (a)). The review team produced a separate report to address the needs of the GDG developing the MDA recommendation for transmission reduction. The main objective of the review was to synthesize evidence on the efficacy and safety of giving a full therapeutic course of antimalarial medicine at approximately the same time to people residing in defined geographical areas with ongoing human malaria transmission to reduce the burden of clinical disease from P. falciparum and P. vivax. Secondary objectives included summarizing evidence on contextual factors that affect the implementation of MDA and findings from mathematical modelling studies with respect to the impact of different operational factors on MDA efficacy. The primary outcome of interest was confirmed clinical malaria at 0–1 months, 1–3 months, 4–12 months, and 12–24 months post-MDA. Secondary outcomes of interest included: hospital admissions (all-cause and malaria-specific); all-cause mortality; parasite prevalence; adverse events; anaemia; drug resistance; severe malaria; and blood transfusions. The systematic review was supplemented by a cross-cutting review on chemoprevention drug resistance (Plowe unpublished evidence), a civil society consultation report on chemoprevention (CS4ME unpublished evidence) and contributions from the GDG membership, which included national malaria programme representatives. The systematic review identified 20 studies: eight provided data on P. falciparum (five cluster-randomized controlled studies and three non-randomized studies); five cluster-randomized controlled trials provided data on both P. falciparum and P. vivax; and an additional seven studies provided data on P. vivax only (all non-randomized, before-after studies) (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (a)). The drugs used for MDA in studies evaluating an effect on P. falciparum included: amodiaquine (1); AS-AQ (1); chloroquine (1); DHAP (8); pyronaridine-artesunate (1); sufalene-pyrimethamine (1); and SP+AS (2). The drugs used for MDA in studies evaluating an effect on P. vivax included: atebrin (1); chloroquine (2); chloroquine plus pyrimethamine (1); DHAP (5); and pyrimethamine (3). Seven of the 13 studies evaluating an effect on P. falciparum included an 8-aminoquinoline, such as low-dose primaquine, as did seven of the 12 studies evaluating an effect on P. vivax. P. falciparum gametocytes and P. vivax hypnozoites are eliminated by 8-aminoquinolines, but these drugs may cause haemolysis in people with G6PD deficiency. None of the P. vivax studies included anti-relapse treatment. Follow-up ranged from 0 to 24 months.",

P. falciparum gametocytes and P. vivax hypnozoites are eliminated by 8-aminoquinolines, but these drugs may cause haemolysis in people with G6PD deficiency. None of the P. vivax studies included anti-relapse treatment. Follow-up ranged from 0 to 24 months post-MDA for studies investigating P. falciparum and studies looking at both P. falciparum and P. vivax, whereas for P. vivax studies, follow-up ranged from 0 to 12 months post-MDA. Studies that reported data on P. falciparum were stratified into areas of moderate to high (>10% prevalence of P. falciparum infection) versus low to very low (≤10% prevalence of P. falciparum infection) transmission due to heterogeneity in the outcomes. Three studies were not included in the review due to an imbalance of background interventions. In addition, large-scale operational experience of MDA in Central Asia, China and Russian Federation, among others, was not captured, although MDA has been a prominent feature of control and elimination efforts in those settings. Summary of judgements Evidence from the systematic review (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (a)) and supporting information (CS4ME unpublished evidence; Plowe unpublished evidence) was appraised by the GDG in October 2021. The evidence and their judgements are captured in the Evidence-to-Decision table. Where the GDG felt there were differences in moderate to high versus very low to low transmission areas, a separate assessment was made for each transmission setting. The GDG determined that the balance of effects favoured MDA for short-term disease burden reduction in moderate to high P. falciparum transmission settings, given the moderate-certainty evidence that MDA reduces the incidence of P. falciparum infection 1–3 months post-MDA and has a consistent-sized effect on clinical outcomes. The GDG also considered it plausible that a reduction in the incidence of infection would translate into an impact on disease. The balance of effects with regard to burden reduction thus favoured implementation of MDA in moderate to high transmission P. falciparum settings for short-term reduction of disease burden. There was insufficient evidence from field trials on the impact of MDA as a long-term (e.g. >1 year) intervention on disease burden in moderate to high transmission areas. In very low to low P. falciparum transmission settings, the GDG favoured standard care over MDA for malaria disease burden reduction, given the low certainty of evidence of desirable effects and the low disease burden in low P. falciparum transmission settings: burden reduction alone was not considered adequate justification for implementing MDA in such settings due to the small gains in burden reduction from MDA. The overall balance of effects for MDA for burden reduction in P. vivax transmission settings was not considered by the GDG, given the weak and conflicting available evidence. The GDG considered that implementation of MDA was associated with moderate costs and that MDA was considered cost-effective to reduce disease burden in moderate to high transmission settings; however, it was not considered cost-effective for burden reduction in very low to low transmission settings due to the fewer cases averted in these contexts. MDA was probably acceptable to key stakeholders, and the feasibility of MDA implementation was deemed variable, as this is highly context-specific. had negative impressions of MDA. In areas where other malaria interventions had been implemented effectively, MDA for malaria was viewed more positively. More information can be found in the systematic review (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (a)). Feasibility The feasibility of implementing MDA varies and is highly context-specific, with more remote or mobile populations being harder to reach. More information can be found in the systematic review (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (a)). Studies evaluating MDA have generally explored the potential of MDA to reduce transmission. Such studies prioritize infection end-points and this may limit their ability to detect clinical outcomes. The certainty of evidence on clinical outcomes was considered low, and confidence intervals crossed the null. However, the GDG considered it biologically plausible that a reduction in the incidence of infection would translate into impact on disease, and recognized that the point estimates of effect sizes against these end-points were consistent with each other. The GDG concluded that a conditional recommendation should be made for MDA for short-term burden reduction in moderate to high transmission settings, given the large impact on burden reduction, low risk of adverse events, moderate costs, likelihood of increasing equity in terms of access to health interventions, and likely acceptability of short-term MDA in most settings. However, the feasibility of delivering the intervention could vary and warrants careful consideration in each setting. The GDG determined that the recommendation should apply to areas with mainly P. falciparum transmission, as there was little and contradictory evidence for P. vivax. Implementation Please refer to the Mass drug administration for falciparum malaria: a practical field manual [137]. Evaluation Mass drug administration for falciparum malaria: a practical field manual [137] should be used to monitor MDA programmes for burden reduction. Programmes should include monitoring of efficacy, drug safety and adverse events, drug resistance and the impact of MDA on morbidity and mortality. Malaria programmes are also encouraged to evaluate the operational effectiveness and costs of implementation of MDA within their contexts. Research needs Evidence gaps requiring further research include: • the comparative value of age-targeted chemoprevention (e.g. SMC) vs MDA in terms of disease burden reduction; • the relative cost-effectiveness of MDA vs targeted chemoprevention (e.g. SMC) for burden reduction; • the effectiveness of MDA based on different dosing schedules and duration; • MDA drug choice options for young infants; • MDA drug choice options for women in their first trimester of pregnancy. 4.2.6.2 MDA for burden reduction in emergency settings Practical info See section 4.2.6.1 for the recommendation on MDA for burden reduction for further practical considerations. Evidence to decision Conditional recommendation for Low certainty evidence MDA for burden reduction in emergency settings (2022) During emergencies or periods of health service disruption, antimalarial medicine can be used for mass drug administration (MDA) in defined geographical areas to provide short-term reductions in the burden of disease caused by P. falciparum. • MDA may quickly reduce clinical malaria incidence in settings with moderate to high P. falciparum transmission, but the effect wanes within 1–3 months.

As far as possible, MDA should be implemented as part of a package of malaria control measures (including effective case management and appropriate prevention tools and strategies).\n• Malaria programmes should judge the suitability of using MDA in their context based on the desired impact, level of endemicity, and resources required (see “Practical info”).\n• There is very limited evidence on the impact of MDA on disease in emergency settings. However, the biological effects of MDA on disease in non-emergency settings are likely to translate to MDA recipients in emergency settings. The size of effect will vary according to the type of emergency and level of disruption to health services, as well as underlying transmission intensity, choice of drug, delivery method and other factors.\nBenefits and harms • All-cause mortality: The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of MDA in emergency settings on all-cause mortality <1 month (risk ratio: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.57–0.81; very low-certainty evidence) and 1–3 months (odds ratio: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.54–2.04; very low-certainty evidence) post-MDA, among all ages.\n• Hospitalization: MDA in emergency settings may reduce all-cause and malaria-specific hospitalization 0–1 month post-MDA, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n• Confirmed clinical malaria: MDA in emergency settings may reduce parasitologically confirmed malaria 0–1 month post-MDA, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n• Parasitaemia, adverse events, anaemia, drug resistance, severe malaria, or blood transfusions: In the studies that met the inclusion criteria, there was no available evidence for assessment of these outcomes.\nMore information on the evidence can be found in the systematic review (Sayre et al unpublished evidence).\nLow Certainty of the evidence\nThe GDG judged the overall certainty of evidence for all critical outcomes to be low. More information on the certainty of evidence assessments can be found in the ‘research evidence’ tab associated with this recommendation online or in the annex of the pdf version.\nValues and preferences\nThere was no available evidence for assessing preferences or values. The GDG determined that there was probably no important uncertainty or variability in how the main outcomes assessed for MDA are valued across contexts.\nResources\nThere was limited evidence on the cost-effectiveness of MDA in emergency settings. One study estimated that MDA in an emergency setting cost US$ 46 per malaria case averted. WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) 136 of 478\nJustification\nThis recommendation was developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework [122]. Sources of information\nWHO commissioned a systematic review to inform this recommendation on MDA in emergencies or periods of health service disruption. The systematic review aimed to determine whether people residing in malaria-endemic settings during an emergency, in a period of health service disruption, or during a febrile illness epidemic should be given an antimalarial for chemoprevention through MDA. Secondary objectives included summarizing evidence on contextual factors that affect the implementation of MDA in emergencies. Two studies were included in the quantitative assessment – neither of which was a randomized controlled trial. These studies were conducted in Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo with, respectively, two rounds of artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) given five weeks apart and two rounds of AS-AQ followed by one round of pyronaridine-artesunate 4–7 weeks apart (Sayre et al unpublished evidence). The evidence was reviewed by the GDG using the Evidence-to-Decision framework in October 2021. The overall certainty of the evidence regarding the use of MDA in emergency settings was low and the complexity of conducting research in emergency settings was noted by the GDG. Despite the limited evidence of MDA impact on disease in emergency settings, the GDG considered that the biological effects of MDA on disease in non-emergency settings would likely translate to MDA recipients in emergency settings. The size of effect will likely vary according to the type of emergency and level of disruption to health services, as well as factors affecting MDA impact such as underlying transmission intensity, delivery method, and other factors.\nSummary of judgements\nThe GDG determined that the balance between desirable and undesirable effects favoured MDA in emergency settings, and resource requirements would likely vary depending on the nature of the emergency and the setting. In addition, the GDG judged that MDA in emergency settings is probably cost-effective; can be feasible, although this will vary depending on the context; would increase health equity; and is probably acceptable to key stakeholders. Consequently, the GDG concluded that a conditional recommendation should be made for MDA in emergency settings, highlighting the strong ethical and moral imperative for malaria prevention in these contexts.\nEvaluation\nIt is acknowledged that the monitoring and evaluation of MDA in emergencies is particularly challenging. However, programmes should actively consider including systems for monitoring and evaluation to provide evidence for future reviews of this recommendation.\n4.2.6.3 MDA to reduce transmission of P. falciparum in very low to low transmission settings\nMore information on the evidence can be found in the systematic review (Sayre et al unpublished evidence).\nEquity\nNo evidence was available to assess equity.\nAcceptability\nAcceptability of MDA was high, despite challenges to implementation in emergency settings. More information on the evidence can be found in the systematic review (Sayre et al unpublished evidence).\nFeasibility\nAccurate estimation of the target population, supervision of field staff, and inconsistencies in drug supply were among the challenges cited in reports of MDA use in emergency settings. More information on the evidence can be found in the systematic review (Sayre et al unpublished evidence).\nPractical info\nThe WHO guidance document, Mass drug administration for falciparum malaria: a practical field manual provides technical and operational guidance on the practical aspects of organizing a successful MDA program [161]. MDA has been found to have a short-term (1–3 months) impact on P. falciparum transmission in very low to low transmission areas. For MDA to contribute meaningfully towards achievement of malaria elimination, activities must already be in place to capitalize on the reduction in transmission achieved through the strategy. For that reason, if MDA is implemented, it should be as one component of a robust malaria elimination programme that includes, at minimum, good coverage of case-based surveillance, quality-assured parasitological diagnosis, effective antimalarial treatment and additional prevention strategies such as vector control. MDA will have maximal benefit to an elimination programme if the aim is to reduce transmission to the level that intensive surveillance and follow-up of every case can begin. MDA is likely to be most effective at reducing transmission in geographical areas where there is limited risk of importation of",

    "content": "such as vector control. MDA will have maximal benefit to an elimination programme if the aim is to reduce transmission to the level that intensive surveillance and follow-up of every case can begin. MDA is likely to be most effective at reducing transmission in geographical areas where there is limited risk of importation of malaria either from adjacent communities or through travel of the population to endemic areas. Additionally, MDA rounds should be scheduled for time periods when populations exhibit low levels of movement in and out of the area in order to increase coverage of the intervention and reduce risk of importation. The impact of MDA will be greater, and last longer, if a large proportion of the population present in the area benefits from the treatment and prophylaxis provided by the medicine and if the rate of parasite importation is low. The frequency of rounds and duration of the MDA programme should take into account the local malaria epidemiology, the length of the prophylactic period provided by the antimalarial used, and the feasibility and cost of delivering each additional round. Consistent with trial data, mathematical models predicted that a single round of MDA would lead to an initial decrease in infections, but that the duration of effect would be short lived. Application of additional rounds is predicted to substantially improve the impact and duration of effect, but attempts should be made in later rounds to reach individuals who did not participate in earlier rounds. Achieving high coverage of the population and good adherence to the antimalarial medicine are critical aspects of MDA programmes. MDA programmes ask many asymptomatic, healthy people to take a medicine when they do not feel ill, with the potential for adverse reactions to occur. Improving coverage and adherence requires development of understanding and trust in the institutions implementing the programme. Community engagement is thus a key factor in determining the success of MDA in order to improve participation rates and adherence to the full treatment course of the medicine. A complete therapeutic course of antimalarial medicine, at doses recommended by the manufacturer, should be given to all eligible adults and children within the defined geographic area. Drug dosage should be determined by weight wherever possible, with dosing according to age only in situations where the person’s weight is unknown. The antimalarial medicines chosen for use in MDA should: a) be WHO recommended and prequalified; b) be efficacious against local parasites; c) be different from the medicine used as first-line treatment, where possible; d) have a superior safety and tolerability profile; e) provide a longer duration of post-treatment prophylaxis with component medicines that have closely matched pharmacology to reduce the risk of new infections encountering only a single drug; f) have a positive public reputation and acceptability; and g) be available and low-cost. Programmes may consider including a single, low-dose of primaquine in MDA programmes in order to increase the gametocytocidal effect, although the evidence was insufficient to discern an additional benefit of single low-dose primaquine. A drug regimen that can be administered as a directly-observed single dose is preferred to multi-day regimens. Depending on the medicine chosen, certain population groups may need to be excluded from MDA, such as: pregnant women in their first trimester; infants < 6 months of age or weighing < 5kgs; people recently treated with the same medicine; people with a known allergy to the medicine; anyone with severe acute illness or unable to take oral medication; people taking medication known to interact with the medicine used for MDA; and people with specific contraindications to the medicine used [161]. MDA should not be given to individuals receiving other forms of malaria chemoprevention (e.g. seasonal malaria chemoprevention, perennial malaria chemoprevention, or intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy). Conditional recommendation for MDA to reduce transmission of P. falciparum in very low to low transmission settings (2022) [Low certainty evidence]. In areas with very low to low levels of P. falciparum transmission, antimalarial medicine can be given as chemoprevention through mass drug administration (MDA) to reduce transmission. MDA may quickly reduce transmission of P. falciparum in very low to low transmission areas, but the effect wanes within 1–3 months. Therefore, if MDA is implemented, it should be one of several components of a robust malaria elimination programme (including, at minimum, good coverage of case-based surveillance with parasitological diagnosis, effective antimalarial treatment, and appropriate prevention tools and strategies) in order to reduce the risk of resurgence after the MDA programme has ended. MDA should be considered only for geographical areas where there is limited risk of importation of malaria either from adjacent communities or through travel of the population to endemic areas. Malaria programmes should consider whether sufficient resources are available to implement MDA without affecting other components of a robust malaria elimination programme. Very low to low transmission settings are defined as areas with P. falciparum parasite prevalence less than 10%, or P. falciparum incidence less than 250 cases per 1000 population per year [30]. These thresholds should not be regarded as absolutes for determining applicability of MDA implementation for transmission reduction. MDA implemented in areas with levels of transmission near these cut-offs may reduce both disease burden and transmission intensity. Evidence to decision: Benefits and harms. The systematic review identified eight community-randomized controlled trials (cRCTs) in very low to low transmission settings in six countries (Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, United Republic of Tanzania, Viet Nam, and Zambia) assessing the impact of MDA on P. falciparum [compared] to no MDA (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (b)). The time periods for results were grouped as 1–3, 4–12 and 12–24 months after the last round of MDA. The results below report the absolute effects (risk differences) of the intervention, as these were used by the GDG in its judgements; relative effect sizes are available under Research evidence. Immediate-to-short-term benefit 1–3 months after the last round of MDA: • MDA probably reduces P. falciparum prevalence (risk difference [RD]: -18 cases per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -20 to -14 per 1000 persons; eight cRCTs; moderate-certainty evidence). • MDA probably reduces the incidence of P. falciparum (RD: -8 cases per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: -10 to -4 per 1000 p-y; one cRCT; moderate-certainty evidence). • MDA may result in little to no difference in the incidence of P. falciparum clinical malaria (RD: -3 cases per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: -5 to 11 per 1000 p-y; two cRCTs; low-certainty evidence). Medium-term benefit 4–12 months after the last round of MDA: • MDA may result in little to no difference in P. falciparum prevalence (RD: -3 per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -8 to 4 per 1000 persons; six cRCTs; low-certainty evidence). • The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of MDA on the incidence of P. falciparum clinical",

The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of MDA on the incidence of P. falciparum clinical malaria (RD: -6 per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: -9 to 0 per 1000 p-y; four cRCTs; very low-certainty evidence). Long-term benefit 12–24 months after the last round of MDA: The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of MDA on the prevalence of P. falciparum (RD: -21 per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -30 to 31 per 1000 persons; one cRCT; very low-certainty evidence). MDA may reduce the incidence of P. falciparum clinical malaria (RD: -4 per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: 14 to 34 per 1000 p-y; one cRCT; low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events: At 0–3 months, MDA probably has little to no effect on serious adverse events (RD: 1 per 1000 persons; 95% CI: 0 to 11 per 1000 persons; one cRCT; moderate-certainty evidence). At 4–12 months, MDA may increase serious adverse events slightly (RD: 2 per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -1 to 8 per 1000 persons; one cRCT; moderate-certainty evidence). Among people who participated in MDA, the rate of serious adverse events was 0.03 per 1000 doses of antimalarial medicine (four cRCTs; not GRADEd because no information was available from the comparator arm). Adverse events: At 1–3 months, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of MDA on adverse events (RD: 300 per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -43 to 1937 per 1000 persons; one cRCT; very low-certainty evidence). Among people who participated in MDA, the rate of adverse events was 4.6 per 1000 doses of antimalarial medicine (four cRCTs; not GRADEd because no information was available from the comparator arm). Artemisinin resistance markers (PfKelch13): At 1–3 months after the last round, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of MDA on artemisinin resistance markers (PfKelch13) among P. falciparum infections (RD: -109 per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -334 to 310 per 1000 persons; one cRCT very low-certainty evidence). At 1–3 months after the last round MDA may reduce the proportion of artemisinin resistance markers (PfKelch13) among all participants (RD: -56 per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -61 to -45 per 1000 persons; one cRCT; low-certainty evidence). At 4–12 months after the last round, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of MDA on the proportion of infections with artemisinin resistance markers (PfKelch13) among all P. falciparum infections (RD: 98 per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -104 to 372 per 1000 persons; one cRCT; very low-certainty evidence). At 4–12 months after the last round, MDA may reduce the proportion of artemisinin resistance markers (PfKelch13) among all participants (RD: -15 per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -21 to -4 per 1000 persons; one cRCT; low-certainty evidence). At 12–24 months after the last round, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of MDA on the proportion of infections with artemisinin resistance markers (PfKelch13) among all P. falciparum infections (RD: 50 per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -129 to 286 per 1000 persons; one cRCT; very low-certainty evidence). At 12–24 months after the last round, MDA may reduce the proportion of artemisinin resistance markers (PfKelch13) among all participants (RD: -9 per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -15 to 3 per 1000 persons; one cRCT; low-certainty evidence). Judgement of the panel: The GDG noted the difficulty in judging the effect of MDA on P. falciparum in very low to low transmission settings given the small number of studies identified by the systematic review with outcomes of interest and the overall low certainty of the evidence. The GDG assessed the size of the desirable effects to be moderate and the undesirable effects to be small. The GDG judged the balance of effects to probably favour MDA for P. falciparum in areas of very low to low transmission, although there was concern about the sustainability of impact if only one or two rounds are conducted. Low Certainty of the evidence: The overall certainty of the evidence was judged to be low. Values and preferences: No studies were identified regarding preferences and values. The GDG judged that there may be important uncertainty or variability in the preferences or values that could not be determined due to the lack of studies. Resources: The systematic review identified four studies with information on resource needs for MDA (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (b)). The cost of MDA varied from ~US$ 1.04 to US$ 19.40 per person per round; one study estimated that drugs accounted for 70% of the cost of MDA. Compared to reactive drug administration (RDA), MDA was superior in all cost-effectiveness measures, including cost per infection averted, cost per case averted, cost per death averted, and cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. Furthermore, the cost of MDA per person reached was substantially lower in an operational setting (US$ 2.90) than in a research setting (US$ 4.71). The GDG judged the resources required to implement MDA to be large. The GDG found it difficult to judge the cost-effectiveness of MDA as the evidence of an effect was of low certainty, and both the effectiveness and cost of the intervention are likely to vary depending on the time period over which outcomes are measured and whether elimination is achieved. However, the GDG concluded that cost-effectiveness in very low to low transmission areas probably favoured the intervention. Equity: No studies were identified that addressed the issue of whether MDA increased or decreased health equity. The GDG judged that the impact of MDA on equity is likely to vary. While MDA has the potential to reach people who might have difficulty accessing other malaria prevention and treatment services, MDA might also expose many people to antimalarials who were not infected. The GDG felt that MDA could exacerbate inequity if not implemented appropriately or if implementation resulted in only a small, temporary effect. However, if implementation of MDA contributed to elimination of P. falciparum, then the intervention would likely improve equity. Acceptability: The systematic review identified 18 studies with information on acceptability (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (b)). The most common barrier to acceptability of MDA reported in the literature was fear of adverse events. Two studies found that participants were concerned that adverse events from MDA might inhibit their economic productivity, although in another study respondents felt that malaria infection was more likely to limit economic activity than adverse events from MDA. One study found that, in addition to sensitization on the benefits of MDA, providing healthcare to communities participating in MDA helped to reduce concerns about adverse effects; however, another study found that the presence of expatriate physicians, an ambulance, and the unfamiliar informed consent process elevated rather than reduced concerns. Previous experience reinforced initial perceptions of MDA: individuals who had been part of previous MDA trials shared stories in their communities.",

    "content": "communities participating in MDA helped to reduce concerns about adverse effects; however, another study found that the presence of expatriate physicians, an ambulance, and the unfamiliar informed consent process elevated rather than reduced concerns. Previous experience reinforced initial perceptions of MDA: individuals who had been part of previous MDA trials shared stories in their communities; if those experiences were poor, community members had negative impressions of MDA. In areas where other malaria interventions had been implemented effectively, MDA for malaria was viewed more positively. One study found that reported acceptability of MDA increased from 62% before the intervention to 98% after, while the proportion of respondents who answered that MDA could cause side effects decreased from 30% to 20% in the same timeframe.\nCommon themes in analyses of drivers of acceptance were sensitization or education about the intervention, support from a range of local authority figures, and additional health support. One study reported that “Respondents who felt that they have received enough information… were more likely to participate in all rounds of MDA,” a theme that was reiterated in five other studies.\nOne study found that a lack of engagement with local healthcare providers limited adherence due to conflicting messages around the efficacy of MDA.\nThe GDG judged the acceptability of MDA for P. falciparum in very low to low transmission settings to vary depending on whether factors that affect community and individual acceptability have been appropriately addressed in the design of the intervention. The GDG considered that a country’s previous experience with MDA, whether positive or negative, was likely to affect their level of acceptance of the intervention. The GDG suggested that a key consideration was whether malaria programme staff find MDA to be an acceptable intervention, but no surveys of this key stakeholder were identified.\nFeasibility The systematic review identified 13 studies providing information on the feasibility of implementation of MDA (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (b)). Ten studies described barriers to implementing WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO)\n141 of 478\nJustification\nThe systematic review of the impact of MDA on P. falciparum identified significant heterogeneity in the meta-analysis of a key outcome (prevalence of infection 1–3 months after the last round of MDA) (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (b)). A subgroup analysis found that the heterogeneity between studies could be explained by differences between higher and lower transmission settings. In the systematic review, a cut-off of 10% prevalence of P. falciparum infection and incidence of 250 P. falciparum cases per 1000 population per year was used to differentiate between areas of very low to low transmission and areas of moderate to high transmission. As higher transmission settings have a larger parasite reservoir, higher rate of new infections and often greater vectorial capacity than lower transmission settings, it is biologically plausible for MDA to have a differential impact on transmission reduction depending on the transmission setting. As a result, the systematic review stratified all analyses by transmission setting, and separate recommendations were developed on the use of MDA for reducing transmission of P. falciparum in very low to low and moderate to high transmission areas.\nThe GDG concluded that the balance of effects probably favoured implementation of MDA to reduce P. falciparum transmission in very low to low transmission settings although there were concerns about the sustainability of impact if only one or two rounds are implemented. The GDG judged that the resources required for implementation of MDA were large and could impact negatively on the implementation of other recommended malaria prevention strategies. While there were limited data on cost-effectiveness, the GDG judged that cost-effectiveness probably favoured MDA but would depend on the time period over which outcomes were measured; if elimination were achieved, in part, through MDA, the cost-effectiveness would be very high. The GDG judged that the acceptability of the intervention was likely to vary depending on the stakeholder group and the population’s previous experience with MDA. The feasibility of implementing the intervention was judged to vary depending on the size of the population to be covered. The GDG concluded that a conditional recommendation for MDA for P. falciparum in very low to low transmission settings should be issued given the moderate-certainty evidence for a short-term benefit, variability around issues such as acceptability and feasibility and large resource requirements.\nResearch needs\n• Further evidence is needed on the impact (incidence or prevalence of malaria infection at the community level) and potential harms/unintended consequences of MDA for P. falciparum in very low to low transmission areas, including resistance to antimalarial medicines. Evidence of impact disaggregated by sex, age and socioeconomic status is needed to understand whether there are any equity considerations.\n• Determine the optimal timing and number of MDA rounds to maximize the impact (incidence or prevalence of malaria infection at the community level) of MDA on P. falciparum in very low to low transmission areas.\n• Determine the minimum effective coverage of MDA in the population to maximize the impact (incidence or prevalence of malaria infection at the community level) of MDA on P. falciparum in very low to low transmission areas.\n• Determine whether multiple years of effective coverage of MDA as part of an elimination programme is feasible and acceptable and whether it can contribute to interrupting P. falciparum transmission in very low to low transmission areas.\n• Investigate approaches to improving the acceptability of MDA and adherence to antimalarial medicines in very low to low transmission areas.\n• Determine whether the addition of single, low-dose primaquine modifies the impact (incidence or prevalence of malaria infection at the community level) of MDA on P. falciparum in very low to low transmission areas.\n4.2.6.4 MDA to reduce transmission of P. falciparum in moderate to high transmission settings\nMDA due to residents’ absence. Of these, three studies noted that absenteeism was one of the major driving forces of non-adherence to medicine. One study noted that determining participants’ seasonal mobility prior to the MDA campaign had contributed to the success of the campaign. Three studies noted difficulties related to determining the optimal timing of the MDA campaign: weather-related challenges, agricultural activities, overlaps with religious events, especially those involving fasting, unpredictable policy changes at the national level and the school year. Feasibility concerns related to participants’ religion were further noted in one study that attempted to implement directly observed drug administration but found that some women were unwilling to remove their face coverings in front of strangers.

Moderate to high transmission settings are defined as areas with P. falciparum parasite prevalence greater than 10%, or P. falciparum incidence above 250 cases per 1000 population per year [30]. These thresholds should not be regarded as absolutes for determining applicability of MDA. Benefits and harms The systematic review identified two cRCTs and two nonrandomised studies (NRSs) in moderate to high transmission settings in four countries (Burkina Faso, Gambia, Nigeria and Zambia) assessing the impact of MDA on P. falciparum compared to no MDA (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (b)).

Medium-term benefit 4–12 months after the last round of MDA • MDA may result in little to no difference in P. falciparum prevalence (RD: -87 per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -53 to 271 per 1000 persons; one cRCT; low-certainty evidence). • MDA may reduce P. falciparum prevalence (RD: -167 per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -188 to -138 per 1000 persons; one NRS; low-certainty evidence) • The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of MDA on the incidence of P. falciparum parasitaemia (RD: -10 per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: -49 to 54 per 1000 p-y; one cRCT; very low-certainty evidence). Long-term benefit 12–24 months after the last round of MDA • MDA may reduce P. falciparum prevalence (RD: -99 per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: -129 to -69 per 1000 p-y; one NRS; low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events • Among people who participated in MDA, the rate of serious adverse events was 0.01 per 1000 doses of antimalarial medicine (one cRCT; not GRADEd because no information was available from the comparator arm). WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) 143 of 478 --- Page Break --- Adverse events • The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of MDA on adverse events (RD: 200 per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -39 to 572 per 1000 persons; one cRCT; very low-certainty evidence). • Among people who participated in MDA, the rate of adverse events was 2.0 per 1000 doses of antimalarial medicine (one cRCT; not GRADEd because no information was available from the comparator arm). Judgement of the panel The GDG noted the difficulty in judging the effect of MDA on P. falciparum in moderate to high transmission settings given how few studies with the outcomes of interest were identified by the systematic review and the overall very low certainty of evidence. The GDG judged that the sizes of both the desirable and undesirable effects were small, and the balance of effects probably did not favour MDA to reduce transmission of P. falciparum in moderate to high transmission settings. In addition, the GDG was concerned that any impact of MDA would be very short-lived in a moderate to high transmission setting. Very low Certainty of the evidence The overall certainty of evidence was judged to be very low. Values and preferences No studies were identified regarding preferences and values. The GDG judged that there may be important uncertainty or variability in preferences or values that could not be determined due to the lack of studies. Resources The systematic review identified four studies with information on resource needs for MDA (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (b)). The cost of MDA varied from ~US$ 1.04 to US$ 19.40 per person per round; one study estimated that drugs accounted for 70% of the cost of MDA. Compared to reactive drug administration (RDA), MDA was superior in all cost-effectiveness measures, including cost per infection averted, cost per case averted, cost per death averted, and cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. Furthermore, the cost of MDA per person reached was substantially lower in an operational setting (US$ 2.90) than in a research setting (US$ 4.71). The GDG judged the resources required to implement MDA to be large. The GDG judged that cost-effectiveness probably favoured no MDA but found it difficult to judge the cost-effectiveness of MDA as the evidence for an effect was of very low certainty and both the effectiveness and cost of the intervention are likely to vary depending on the time period over which they are measured. Equity The systematic review did not identify any research that addressed the issue of how MDA affects health equity. The GDG judged the impact of implementing MDA on equity to vary. While MDA had the potential to reach people who might have difficulty accessing other malaria prevention and treatment services, it also exposes uninfected people to the potential adverse effects of antimalarials. The GDG felt that MDA could exacerbate inequity if not implemented appropriately or if implementation resulted only in a small, temporary effect. Acceptability The systematic review identified 18 studies with information on acceptability (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (b)). The most common barrier to acceptability of MDA reported in the literature was fear of adverse events. Two studies found that participants were concerned that adverse events WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) 144 of 478 --- Page Break --- Justification",

    "content": "Unpublished evidence (b). The most common barrier to acceptability of MDA reported in the literature was fear of adverse events. Two studies found that participants were concerned that adverse events from MDA might inhibit their economic productivity, although in another study respondents felt that malaria infection was more likely to limit economic activity than adverse events. The GDG judged that the balance of effects probably favoured not implementing MDA to reduce P. falciparum transmission in moderate to high transmission settings. The GDG judged that the resources required for implementation of MDA were large and could impact negatively on the implementation of other recommended malaria prevention strategies. While cost-effectiveness data were limited, the GDG judged that cost-effectiveness probably did not favour MDA in moderate to high transmission settings. The GDG judged that the acceptability of the intervention was likely to vary depending on the stakeholder group and previous experience of the population with MDA. The feasibility of implementing the intervention was judged to vary depending on the size of the population to be covered. The GDG concluded that there should be a conditional recommendation against the implementation of MDA to reduce transmission of P. falciparum in moderate to high transmission settings given the lack of evidence for either a short- or long-term benefit, variability around issues such as acceptability and feasibility and large resource requirements. One study found that, in addition to sensitization on the benefits of MDA, providing healthcare to communities participating in MDA helped to reduce concerns about adverse effects; however, another study found that the presence of expatriate physicians, an ambulance, and the unfamiliar informed consent process elevated rather than reduced concerns. Previous experience reinforced initial perceptions of MDA: individuals who had been part of previous MDA trials shared stories in their communities; if those experiences were poor, community members had negative impressions of MDA. In areas where other malaria interventions had been implemented effectively, MDA for malaria was viewed more positively. One study found that reported acceptability of MDA increased from 62% before the intervention to 98% after, while the proportion of respondents who answered that MDA could cause side effects decreased from 30% to 20% in the same timeframe. Common themes in analyses of drivers of acceptance were sensitization or education about the intervention, support from a range of local authority figures, and additional health support. One study reported that “Respondents who felt that they have received enough information… were more likely to participate in all rounds of MDA,” a theme that was reiterated in five other studies. One study found that a lack of engagement with local healthcare providers limited adherence due to conflicting messages around the efficacy of MDA. The GDG judged the acceptability of MDA for P. falciparum in moderate to high transmission settings to depend on whether factors that affect community and individual acceptability have been appropriately addressed in the design of the intervention. The GDG considered that a country’s previous experience with MDA, whether positive or negative, was likely to affect their level of acceptance of the intervention. The GDG suggested that a key consideration was whether malaria programme staff find MDA to be an acceptable intervention, but no surveys of this key stakeholder were identified. Feasibility. The systematic review identified 13 studies providing information on the feasibility of implementation of MDA (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (b)). Ten studies described barriers to implementing MDA due to residents’ absence. Of these, three studies noted that absenteeism was one of the major driving forces of non-adherence to medicine. One study noted that determining participants’ seasonal mobility prior to the MDA campaign had contributed to the success of the campaign. Three studies noted difficulties related to determining the optimal timing of the MDA campaign: weather-related challenges, agricultural activities, overlaps with religious events, especially those involving fasting, unpredictable policy changes at the national level and the school year. Feasibility concerns related to participants’ religion were further noted in one study that attempted to implement directly observed drug administration but found that some women were unwilling to remove their face coverings in front of strangers. This issue was resolved by creating sequestered administration sites staffed by accepted local staff. The GDG judged the feasibility of implementing MDA to vary depending on the size of the population, with improved feasibility in smaller populations and island communities. MDA to reduce transmission of P. vivax Practical info. MDA without an 8-aminoquinoline medicine may have a short-term (1–3 months) impact on P. vivax transmission. For MDA to contribute meaningfully towards achievement of malaria elimination, activities must already be in place to capitalize on the reduction in transmission achieved through the strategy. For that reason, MDA should be implemented as a component of a robust malaria elimination programme that includes, at minimum, good coverage of case-based surveillance, quality-assured parasitological diagnosis, effective antimalarial treatment and additional prevention strategies such as vector control. MDA will have maximal benefit to an elimination programme if the aim is to reduce transmission to the level that intensive surveillance and follow-up of every case can begin. MDA is likely to be most effective at reducing transmission in geographical areas where there is limited risk of importation of malaria either from adjacent communities or through travel of the population to endemic areas. Additionally, MDA rounds should be scheduled for time periods when populations exhibit low levels of movement in and out of the area in order to increase coverage of the intervention and reduce risk of importation. The impact of MDA will be greater, and last longer, if a large proportion of the population present in the area benefits from the treatment and prophylaxis provided by the medicine and if the rate of parasite importation is low. The frequency of rounds and duration of the MDA programme should take into account the local malaria epidemiology, the half-life of the antimalarial used, and the feasibility and cost of delivering each additional round. Consistent with trial data, mathematical models predicted that a single round of MDA would lead to an initial decrease in infections, but that the duration of effect would be short lived. Application of additional rounds is predicted to substantially improve the impact and duration of effect. Achieving high coverage of the population and good adherence to the antimalarial medicine are critical aspects of MDA programmes.

Achieving high coverage of the population and good adherence to the antimalarial medicine are critical aspects of MDA programmes. MDA programmes ask many asymptomatic, healthy people to take a medicine when they do not feel ill, with the potential for adverse reactions to occur. Improving coverage and adherence requires development of understanding and trust in the institutions implementing the programme. Community engagement is thus a key factor in determining the success of MDA, to improve participation rates and adherence to the full treatment course of the medicine. A complete therapeutic course of antimalarial medicine, at doses recommended by the manufacturer, should be given to all eligible adults and children within the defined geographic area. Drug dosage should be determined by weight wherever possible, with dosing according to age only in situations where the person’s weight is unknown. The antimalarial medicines chosen for use in MDA should: a) be WHO recommended and prequalified; b) be efficacious against local parasites; c) be different from the medicine used as first-line treatment, where possible; d) have a superior safety and tolerability profile; e) provide a longer duration of post-treatment prophylaxis with component medicines that have closely matched pharmacology to reduce the risk of new infections encountering only a single drug; f) have a positive public reputation and acceptability; and g) be available and low-cost. A drug regimen that can be administered as a directly-observed single dose is preferred to multi-day regimens. Depending on the medicine chosen, certain population groups may need to be excluded from MDA, such as: pregnant women in their first trimester; infants < 6 months of age or weighing <5kgs; people recently treated with the same medicine; people with a known allergy to the medicine; anyone with severe acute illness or unable to take oral medication; people taking medication known to interact with the medicine used for MDA; and people with specific contraindications to the medicine used [161]. MDA should not be given to individuals receiving other forms of malaria chemoprevention (e.g. seasonal malaria chemoprevention, perennial malaria chemoprevention, or intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy). MDA for P. vivax is complicated because many P. vivax infections are likely to be dormant stages (hypnozoites) in the liver that will not be cured unless an 8-aminoquinoline, the only type of medicine that treats hypnozoites, is administered. Without provision of an 8-aminoquinoline, a large proportion of P. vivax cases treated in the MDA programme will relapse within a few months. However, programmes contemplating providing medicine for radical cure of P. vivax as part of MDA should carefully consider whether it is feasible to administer this treatment regimen safely, i.e. with testing for G6PD deficiency prior to treatment, an effective pharmacovigilance system and emergency access to blood transfusion services. Programmes should also consider whether sufficient coverage and adherence to the full course of radical cure can be achieved. Conditional recommendation for MDA to reduce transmission of P. vivax (2022): In areas with P. vivax transmission, antimalarial medicine can be given as chemoprevention through mass drug administration (MDA) to reduce transmission. • MDA may quickly reduce transmission of P. vivax, but the effect wanes within 1–3 months. Therefore, if MDA is implemented, it should be one of several components of a robust malaria elimination programme (including, at minimum, good coverage of case-based surveillance with parasitological diagnosis, effective antimalarial treatment including treatment for hypnozoites, and appropriate prevention tools and strategies) in order to reduce the risk of resurgence after the MDA programme has ended. • MDA should be considered only for geographical areas where there is limited risk of importation of malaria either from adjacent communities or through travel of the population to endemic areas. • Malaria programmes should consider whether sufficient resources are available to implement MDA without affecting other components of a robust malaria elimination programme. • Programmes considering implementing MDA for P. vivax should carefully reflect on how to safely and feasibly administer treatment to prevent relapses. Evidence to decision: Benefits and harms. The systematic review identified five cRCTs and six NRSs in eight countries (Cambodia, India, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Panama, Solomon Islands, Venezuela [Bolivarian Republic of] and Viet Nam) assessing the impact of MDA on P. vivax transmission to no MDA (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (b)). None of the cRCTs and only one of the NRSs used sufficient dosage of an 8-aminoquinoline to achieve radical cure of P. vivax hypnozoites1. The time periods for results were grouped as 1–3, 4–12 and 12–24 months after the last round of MDA. The results below report the absolute effects (risk differences) of the intervention, as these were used by the GDG in its judgements; relative effect sizes are available in the Research evidence. Immediate-to-short-term benefits 1–3 months after the last round of MDA: • MDA may reduce P. vivax prevalence (RD: -113 per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -119 to -101 per 1000 persons; five cRCTs; low-certainty evidence). • The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of MDA on P. vivax prevalence (RD: -189 per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -208 to -155 per 1000 persons; two NRSs; very low-certainty evidence). • The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of MDA on the incidence of P. vivax parasitaemia (risk difference [RD] low transmission: -3 per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: -3 to -3 per 1000. RD high transmission: -113 per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: -122 to -103 per 1000 p-y. two NRSs; very low-certainty evidence). • The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of MDA on the incidence of P. vivax clinical malaria (RD low transmission: -16 per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: -16 to -15 per 1000 p-y. RD high transmission: -111 per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: -115 to -108 per 1000 p-y. two NRSs; very low-certainty evidence). Medium-term benefit 4–12 months after the last round of MDA: • MDA may result in little to no difference in P. vivax prevalence (RD: 1 per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -12 to 17 per 1000 persons; five cRCTs; low-certainty evidence). • The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of MDA on the prevalence of P. vivax (RD: -47 per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -60 to -16 per 1000 persons; one NRS; very low-certainty evidence). • The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of MDA on the incidence of P. vivax clinical malaria (RD: -4 per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: -4 to -3 per 1000 p-y; one NRS; very low-certainty evidence). • The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of MDA on the incidence of P. vivax clinical malaria (RD: -44 per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: -50 to -37 per 1000 p-y; one cRCT; very low-certainty evidence).

Only one of the NRSs and none of the cRCTs identified by the systematic review used sufficient dosage of an 8-aminoquinoline for radical cure of the P. vivax hypnozoite reservoir. The GDG noted that the balance of effects could be different if radical cure of P. vivax was attempted as part of MDA. While a greater impact of MDA on P. vivax would be expected if relapses were prevented through treatment of hypnozoites, potential harms might increase from exposure of G6PD deficient individuals to an 8-aminoquinoline. Levels of acceptability and feasibility might decrease given the need to test for G6PD deficiency, establish or maintain an effective pharmacovigilance system and provide emergency access to blood transfusion services. Therefore, the GDG noted that there was limited evidence on the benefits and harms of including radical cure as part of MDA for P. vivax to inform the recommendation.\nCognizant of the limitations of the available evidence, the GDG judged that the sizes of both the desirable and undesirable effects were small, and the balance of effects did not favour either MDA or no MDA for P. vivax.\n1The systematic review considered the following as the minimum adult dosage of 8-aminoquinoline medicines to achieve radical cure: 210 mg of primaquine over eight weeks; 1.25 g of plasmochin over 14 days. One study considered its primaquine adult dosage regimen (40 mg of primaquine every two weeks for two years) to be radical cure, but as the total dose for an eight-week period (i.e. 160 mg) was less than 210 mg, the systematic review did not consider this to be radical cure (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (b)).\nVery low Certainty of the evidence\nThe overall certainty of the evidence was judged to be very low.\nValues and preferences\nNo studies were identified regarding preferences and values.\nThe GDG judged that there may be important uncertainty or variability in the preferences or values that could not be determined due to the lack of studies.\nResources\nThe systematic review identified four studies with information on resource needs for MDA (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (b)). The cost of MDA varied from ~US$ 1.04 to US$ 19.40 per person per round; one study estimated that drugs accounted for 70% of the cost of MDA. Compared to reactive drug administration (RDA), MDA was superior in all cost-effectiveness measures, including cost per infection averted, cost per case averted, cost per death averted, and cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. Furthermore, the cost of MDA per person reached was substantially lower in an operational setting (US$ 2.90) than in a research setting (US$ 4.71).\nThe GDG judged the resources required to implement MDA to be large. The GDG found it difficult to judge the cost-effectiveness of MDA as there were no data on cost or cost-effectiveness identified in the studies of P. vivax. The GDG judged that the effectiveness and cost of MDA are likely to vary depending on the time period over which they are measured and whether elimination is achieved.\nEquity\nThe systematic review did not identify any research that addressed the issue of how MDA affects health equity.\nThe GDG judged the impact of implementing MDA on equity to vary. While MDA had the potential to reach people who might have difficulty accessing other malaria prevention and treatment services, it also exposes uninfected people to the potential adverse effects of antimalarials. The GDG felt that MDA could exacerbate inequity if not implemented appropriately or if implementation resulted only in a small, temporary effect.\nAcceptability\nThe systematic review identified 18 studies with information on acceptability (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (b)). The most common barrier to acceptability of MDA reported in the literature was fear of adverse events. Two studies found that participants were concerned that adverse events from MDA might inhibit their economic productivity, although in another study respondents felt that malaria infection was more likely to limit economic activity than adverse events.\nOne study found that, in addition to sensitization on the benefits of MDA, providing healthcare to communities participating in MDA helped to reduce concerns about adverse effects; however, another study found that the presence of expatriate physicians, an ambulance, and the unfamiliar informed consent process elevated rather than reduced concerns.

One study found that a lack of engagement with local healthcare providers limited adherence due to conflicting messages around the efficacy of MDA. The GDG judged that the acceptability of MDA for P. vivax would vary depending on whether factors that affect community and individual acceptability have been appropriately addressed in the design of the intervention. The GDG considered that a country’s previous experience with MDA, whether positive or negative, was likely to affect their level of acceptance of the intervention. The GDG suggested that a key consideration is whether malaria programme staff find MDA to be an acceptable intervention, but no surveys of this key stakeholder were identified. The GDG felt that the inclusion of an 8-aminoquinoline in MDA for radical cure would likely have a negative effect on the acceptability of the intervention due to safety concerns and the long treatment period. Justification: The GDG concluded that the balance of effects did not favour either MDA or no MDA to reduce P. vivax transmission. There was a lack of studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of MDA drug regimens that included an 8-aminoquinoline for radical cure of P. vivax; the GDG expressed concern both for the likely decreased long-term effectiveness of MDA for P. vivax without use of an 8-aminoquinoline and the increased complexity of safely administering 8-aminoquinolines. The GDG judged that the resources required for implementation of MDA were large and could impact negatively on the implementation of other recommended malaria strategies. While cost-effectiveness data were limited, the GDG judged that cost-effectiveness probably favoured MDA to reduce P. vivax transmission but would depend on the time period over which it was measured and whether elimination was achieved. The GDG judged that the acceptability of the intervention was likely to vary depending on the stakeholder group, the population’s previous experience with MDA and whether radical cure with an 8-aminoquinoline was included. The feasibility of implementing the intervention was judged to vary depending on the size of the population to be covered and whether radical cure, with the need for G6PD deficiency testing, an effective pharmacovigilance system and emergency access to blood transfusion services, was included in the MDA programme. The GDG concluded that MDA could be a useful intervention if it reduced P. vivax transmission quickly to enable the initiation of intensive surveillance activities. The GDG therefore proposed a conditional recommendation for the use of MDA for P. vivax. Research needs: Further evidence is needed on the impact (incidence or prevalence of malaria infection at the community level) and potential harms/unintended consequences of MDA for P. vivax. Evidence is needed on the acceptability, feasibility, impact (incidence or prevalence of malaria infection at the community level) and potential harms/unintended consequences (death, hospital admission, severe anaemia or any severe adverse event) of safe provision (including testing for G6PD deficiency and, additionally, an effective pharmacovigilance system and emergency access to blood transfusion services) of an 8-aminoquinoline as part of MDA for radical cure of P. vivax. Determine the optimal timing and number of MDA rounds to maximize the impact (incidence or prevalence of malaria infection at the community level) of MDA on P. vivax. Determine the minimum effective coverage of MDA in the population to maximize the impact (incidence or prevalence of malaria infection at the community level) of MDA on P. vivax. Determine whether the degree of geographical isolation of communities or mobility of the population modifies the impact (incidence or prevalence of malaria infection at the community level) of MDA on P. vivax. 4.2.6.6 Mass relapse prevention (MRP) to reduce transmission of P. vivax. Feasibility: The systematic review identified 13 studies providing information on the feasibility of implementation of MDA (Schneider et al unpublished evidence (b)). Ten studies described barriers to implementing MDA due to residents’ absence. Of these, three studies noted that absenteeism was one of the major driving forces of non-adherence to medicine.

This issue was resolved by creating sequestered administration sites staffed by accepted local staff. The GDG judged the feasibility of implementing MDA for P. vivax to vary depending on the size of the population, with improved feasibility in smaller populations and island communities. Feasibility would also vary depending on whether radical cure using an 8-aminoquinoline medicine was part of the MDA strategy, which would necessitate testing for G6PD deficiency, an effective pharmacovigilance system and emergency access to blood transfusion services. Evidence to decision: Conditional recommendation against, Very low certainty evidence. Mass relapse prevention (MRP) to reduce transmission of P. vivax (2022). Mass treatment with an 8-aminoquinoline medicine alone to reduce the transmission of P. vivax is not recommended. Without testing for G6PD deficiency, the GDG noted the potential for severe harm from the use of a therapeutic dose of an 8-aminoquinoline for radical cure of P. vivax hypnozoites. However, conducting G6PD testing for a large population would significantly add to the complexity and cost of the intervention. The GDG noted that there may be highly exceptional circumstances under which mass relapse prevention (MRP) may be appropriate, such as during a small focal outbreak of P. vivax in a temperate area. However, under such circumstances the GDG considered that an MDA programme providing a schizonticide in addition to an 8-aminoquinoline would likely be a better strategy. Benefits and harms: The systematic review identified two NRSs that provided data on MRP for P. vivax (Shah et al unpublished evidence). Studies were conducted in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in 2002 and in the Republic of Azerbaijan in 1970–1971. Both studies provided primaquine for 14 days at 0.25 mg/kg per day, administered in a single round prior to the peak transmission season. The results below report the absolute effects (risk differences) of the intervention, as these were used by the GDG in its judgements; relative effect sizes are available in the Research evidence.",

Both studies provided primaquine for 14 days at 0.25 mg/kg per day, administered in a single round prior to the peak transmission season. The results below report the absolute effects (risk differences) of the intervention, as these were used by the GDG in its judgements; relative effect sizes are available in the Research evidence. Immediate-to-short-term benefit 1–3 months after the last round of MRP. • The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of MRP on the incidence of P. vivax infection. (RD: -102 per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: -103 to -102 per 1000 p-y; two NRSs; very low-certainty evidence). Medium-term benefit 4–12 months after the last round of MRP. • The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of MRP on the prevalence of P. vivax infection (RD: -3 per 1000 persons; 95% CI: -4 to -2 per 1000 persons; one NRS; very low-certainty evidence). • The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of MRP on the incidence of P. vivax infection (RD: -11 per 1000 p-y; 95% CI: -11 to -10 per 1000 p-y; two NRSs; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events. • The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of MRP on adverse events (one NRS; very low-certainty evidence). Judgement of the panel. The GDG could not judge the size of the beneficial effects given the very low certainty of the evidence. However, the GDG was clear that there was the potential for large undesirable effects, given the possibility of severe haemolysis among people with G6PD deficiency who take an 8-aminoquinoline. Overall, the GDG judged the balance of effects to probably favour no MRP. Very low certainty of the evidence. The overall certainty of the evidence was judged to be very low. Justification. The GDG was disappointed in the very low quality of evidence to judge the impact of MRP on P. vivax transmission. The GDG judged that the balance of effects probably favoured no MRP while the feasibility of implementing an MRP programme was very low given the complexity of safely administering radical cure for P. vivax hypnozoites, which would entail a high cost. Additionally, the GDG was concerned that the MRP strategy does not include an antimalarial medicine that targets blood-stage parasites (i.e. schizonticide), given evidence for improved efficacy of primaquine against relapses when co-administered with a schizonticide. The GDG concluded that there should be a conditional recommendation against implementation of the strategy but considered that there may be highly exceptional circumstances, such as a small focal outbreak of P. vivax in a temperate area, under which an MRP intervention might be appropriate. Research needs. The GDG suggested that the strategy could be reconsidered if a new drug to treat hypnozoites was developed that could be administered without the need for G6PD testing. 4.3 Vaccines. The use of vaccines for the prevention of malaria. Immunization has been one of the major success stories for global health and development. Since 1974, vaccination has averted 154 million deaths, with 95% of these in children younger than 5 years of age [162]. Since 2010, at least 116 countries have introduced vaccines they did not previously use, including those against major killers such as pneumococcal pneumonia, diarrhoea, cervical cancer, typhoid, cholera and meningitis. Today, more than 20 life-threatening diseases can now be prevented through immunization. Vaccines are trusted interventions delivered through an effective platform that reaches children with high coverage; in 2023, nearly 85% of infants were vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP dose 3) [163]. Vaccination has accounted for 40% of the observed decline in global infant mortality (52% in the WHO African Region) since 1974. As a result of 50 years of vaccination, a child born today has a 40% increase in survival for each year of infancy and childhood [162]. Values and preferences. No studies were identified regarding preferences and values. The GDG judged that there may be important uncertainty or variability in preferences or values that could not be determined due to the lack of studies. Resources. No studies were identified on the costs of implementing MRP. The GDG judged the costs were likely to be large. Equity. No studies were identified addressing the issue of whether MRP increased or decreased health equity. The GDG judged that equity might be reduced by MRP, given that the undesirable effects were likely to be focalized in a healthy subgroup of the population with G6PD deficiency. Acceptability. No studies were identified on the acceptability of MRP. The GDG was unable to judge whether or not the intervention was acceptable. Feasibility. The systematic review identified one study on the feasibility of implementing MRP, which provided information on the size and composition of implementation teams and how adverse events were identified and managed (Shah et al unpublished evidence). The GDG judged that population screening for G6PD deficiency, along with an effective pharmacovigilance system and emergency access to blood transfusion services, would be needed to implement MRP safely, which would significantly increase the complexity and cost of the intervention. Vaccines have the potential to extend the reach of malaria prevention tools. During the introduction of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine under the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP), more than two thirds of children who reportedly did not sleep under an insecticide-treated net (ITN) received at least one dose of RTS,S/AS01. Overall, vaccine introduction increased the proportion of children with access to one or more malaria prevention tools (ITNs or malaria vaccines) to over 90%. Vaccine uptake was equitable by sex and socioeconomic status and had no negative effects on the uptake of other childhood vaccinations, ITN use or health-seeking behaviour for febrile illness (Full evidence report on the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine, unpublished evidence). Malaria vaccine pipeline. Two malaria vaccines are WHO-prequalified and recommended for use: RTS,S/AS01 and R21/Matrix-M. Both are pre-erythrocytic vaccines that prevent P. falciparum infection and subsequent illness and death in children; the vaccines are not designed to interrupt malaria transmission. The recommended malaria vaccines prevent P. falciparum malaria. There is no known cross-protection with other Plasmodium species. However, in areas where P. falciparum and other Plasmodium species, including P. vivax, are endemic, the vaccine can provide important protection against P. falciparum malaria. A number of additional malaria vaccine candidates are currently in the research pipeline at different stages of clinical development, including other vaccines that also target the pre-erythrocytic stage [164][165]. More recently, vaccine development efforts have also targeted the blood stage (erythrocytic) [166], sexual-stage antigens for the prevention of human-to-mosquito malaria transmission [167], and other malaria species such as P. vivax. New technologies, such as DNA- and mRNA-based vaccines [168][169][170], and the ongoing development of adjuvants [171], are being explored for use in malaria vaccines. In 2014,",

New technologies, such as DNA- and mRNA-based vaccines [168][169][170], and the ongoing development of adjuvants [171], are being explored for use in malaria vaccines. In 2014, WHO published guidelines on the quality, safety and efficacy of recombinant malaria vaccines targeting the pre-erythrocytic and blood stages of P. falciparum [172]. National programmes for immunization and malaria. Malaria vaccines should be provided as part of a comprehensive malaria control strategy. All malaria control interventions, including vaccines, provide partial protection; the highest impact is achieved when a mix of interventions is used. Appropriate mixes of interventions (ITNs, preventive chemotherapies, vaccines, etc.) should be identified for different subnational settings. These mixes are defined by national malaria programmes (NMPs) on the basis of the local malaria epidemiology (e.g. intensity of transmission, age pattern of severe disease, vector species and behaviour, and insecticide and drug resistance patterns) and contextual factors (e.g. structure and function of the health care system). Malaria vaccines should be integrated into relevant immunization guidelines and malaria control strategies, including national strategic plans to define the package of interventions needed to optimize malaria control and elimination in a country. WHO is developing operational guidance on principles for the subnational tailoring of malaria interventions. Country considerations and planning for malaria vaccine introduction should rely on data-driven decision-making in which NMP and Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) staff consider parasite prevalence, disease burden, existing malaria interventions, vaccine delivery, the logistics, strength and support of the immunization programme, and the availability of funding support, among other factors. Decision-making on whether to adopt and implement the malaria vaccine should involve close collaboration among the NMP, EPI and other relevant ministry of health departments. In the countries involved in the pilot implementation of RTS,S/AS01, NMPs actively participated in the vaccine introduction and implementation activities in order to ensure that malaria control perspectives were incorporated and to maximize opportunities for integration. Malaria vaccine technical working groups were established with joint participation of EPI and NMPs to provide technical guidance on decision-making and a forum for alignment. EPI leads the logistics of vaccine roll-out and delivery to relevant health facilities. EPI also manages the planning and activities required for vaccine introduction and programme implementation, such as vaccine and supply procurement; advocacy; communications and social mobilization; training and supervision of health personnel; logistics and cold chain for vaccine storage; service delivery; and monitoring and evaluation. Both fixed sites for vaccination at health care facilities and opportunities for mobile vaccination delivery or outreach services should be considered. To increase uptake, periodic mass vaccination campaigns or periodic intensified routine immunization activities can be deployed. Monitoring of coverage levels occurs through routine health facility data; the malaria vaccine can be integrated into the District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS2) platform alongside NMP and EPI indicators.

WHO guidelines for malaria - 13 August 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO) 153 of 478. Practical info: Vaccine characteristics, content, dosage, administration and storage. RTS,S/AS01 and R21/Matrix-M are pre-erythrocytic vaccines targeting the central repeat amino acid sequence Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro (NANP) region of the P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP). Both vaccines are recombinant protein virus-like particles formed from a fusion protein comprising the CSP region and hepatitis B virus surface antigen (hBsAg) nanoparticles. This recombinant fusion protein is produced through expression in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae for RTS,S and Hansenula polymorpha for R21). The formulation of RTS,S/AS01 consists of 25 μg of RTS,S with the AS01 adjuvant system. This adjuvant system contains the immunomodulatory molecules 3-O-desacyl-f4-monophosphoryl lipid A and a saponin derived from the bark of the Quillaja saponaria tree (QS21) together with liposomes. The RTS,S antigen is lyophilized and needs to be reconstituted with the liquid AS01 adjuvant suspension prior to administration. The vaccine is produced as a two-dose RTS,S powder to be reconstituted with a two-dose AS01 adjuvant suspension. After reconstitution, the total volume is 1 mL (two doses of 0.5 mL each).[186] R21/Matrix-M consists of 5 µg of R21 and 50 µg of Matrix-M, a saponin-derived adjuvant, and is available as a fully liquid single-vial formulation. Each R21/Matrix-M dose is 0.5 mL, with one-dose and two-dose vials available.[187] Strong recommendation for High certainty evidence. Malaria vaccines (2023). WHO recommends the use of malaria vaccines for the prevention of P. falciparum malaria in children living in malaria-endemic areas, prioritizing areas of moderate and high transmission. • Countries should prioritize vaccination in areas of moderate and high transmission [i]. However, countries may also consider providing the vaccine in low transmission settings. Decisions on expanding malaria vaccination to low transmission settings should be considered at country level on the basis of the overall malaria control strategy, affordability, cost-effectiveness and programmatic considerations, such as whether the inclusion would simplify delivery. • Malaria vaccines should be provided in a four-dose schedule in children from 5 months of age for the reduction of malaria disease and burden [ii]. Countries may choose to give the first vaccine dose earlier than 5 months of age on the basis of operational considerations to increase coverage or impact. • The minimum interval between any doses is four weeks; however, to achieve prolonged protection, the fourth dose should be given 6–18 months after the third dose. • To improve coverage, there can be flexibility in the timing of the fourth dose, including by aligning it with vaccines given in the second year of life. Alternatively, because the vaccine efficacy is highest in the first months after vaccination, the fourth dose can be given just prior to seasonal peaks in malaria transmission to optimize vaccine efficacy. • A fifth dose, given one year after the fourth dose, may be provided in areas of highly seasonal transmission and may be considered in other areas where a significant malaria risk remains for children, depending on a local assessment of feasibility and cost-effectiveness. • In areas with highly seasonal malaria transmission or perennial malaria transmission with seasonal peaks, countries may consider providing the vaccine using an age-based or seasonal approach. Alternatively, countries could consider a hybrid of",

Studies with RTS,S/AS01 indicated lower efficacy if the first dose was given around 6 weeks of age. However, the efficacy of RTS,S/AS01 and R21/Matrix-M vaccines is unlikely to be reduced substantially if the first dose is given at 4, rather than 5, months of age. \n\n[iii] An age-based vaccination approach provides the first three vaccine doses when children become age-eligible (with a minimum of four weeks between doses) and a fourth dose 6–18 months after the third dose.

    "content": "WHO-recommended malaria vaccines. Restarting the vaccine series is not recommended.\nCo-administration: RTS,S/AS01 given in conjunction with routine childhood vaccines has been evaluated in several trials [195][196]. Non-inferiority criteria were met for all vaccines given with RTS,S/AS01, compared to the same vaccines given without RTS,S/AS01. RTS,S/AS01 can be given concomitantly with any of the following monovalent or combination vaccines: diphtheria, tetanus, whole-cell pertussis, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, oral poliovirus, measles, rubella, yellow fever, rotavirus and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines [178]. A study is currently under way to assess the safety and immunogenicity of R21/Matrix-M co-administered with yellow fever and measles-rubella vaccine and pentavalent (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b), rotavirus, pneumococcal and oral poliovirus vaccines (NCT05155579) [197].\nRole of the malaria vaccine among other preventive measures: Malaria vaccines should be provided as part of a comprehensive malaria control strategy. All malaria control interventions, including vaccines, provide partial protection; the highest impact is achieved when a mix of interventions is used. Appropriate mixes of interventions (ITNs, preventive chemotherapies, vaccines, etc.) should be identified for different subnational settings. These mixes are defined by national malaria programmes on the basis of the local malaria epidemiology (e.g. intensity of transmission, age pattern of severe disease, vector species and behaviour, and insecticide and drug resistance patterns) and contextual factors (e.g. structure and function of the health care system). The additional visits needed to administer the malaria vaccine are opportunities to provide other integrated malaria control and preventive health services. Efforts should be made to take advantage of these visits to catch up on missed vaccinations, administer vitamin A, carry out deworming, provide ITNs and other preventive interventions, and remind parents and/or caregivers of the importance of continuing to use an ITN every night, using other malaria preventive measures as recommended, and seeking prompt diagnosis and treatment for fever.\nVaccine safety: Both RTS,S/AS01 and R21/Matrix-M vaccines are considered to be safe and well tolerated. There is a small risk of febrile seizures within seven days (mainly within 2–3 days) of vaccination [186][187]. As with any vaccine introduction, proper planning and training of staff to conduct appropriate pharmacovigilance should take place beforehand. Malaria vaccines should not be given to anyone who has experienced a severe allergic reaction after a previous hepatitis B vaccination or malaria vaccine dose or to a vaccine component [186][187].\nVaccination of special populations: Malnourished children may be at particular risk of malaria infection and can be vaccinated with either vaccine. RTS,S/AS01 can be given to children with HIV infection. RTS,S/AS01 has been evaluated in infants with a history of preterm birth (before 37 weeks’ gestation) and/or low birth weight, in HIV-exposed or in HIV-infected infants and children, and in malnourished infants and children. The vaccine was found to be well tolerated and immunogenic in all groups. Antibody titres were lower in HIV-infected children than in children with an unknown or negative HIV status. A study is currently under way to assess the safety and immunogenicity of R21/Matrix-M in HIV-positive (WHO HIV stage 1 or 2 disease) children aged 5–36 months (NCT05385510) [198]. The trial of R21/Matrix-M in HIV-positive infants is ongoing and data are not yet available; therefore, there remains a possibility that the efficacy of R21/Matrix-M could be impaired in these children. The malaria vaccine should be provided to infants and young children who relocate to an area of moderate or high transmission, including during emergency situations. Countries are encouraged to consider strategies to improve coverage in populations with high need and at high risk of malaria burden and disease, including under-vaccinated children, hard-to-reach or marginalized populations, persons in areas of conflict or emergency situations, displaced populations, or those in other areas with poor access to health services. Some of these populations may benefit from delivery through campaigns. The vaccines are not recommended for use in adults (including health workers and pregnant persons). The vaccine is not indicated for travellers, who should use chemoprophylaxis and vector control methods to prevent malaria when travelling to endemic settings.\nSurveillance: As for other vaccines, surveillance should be in place to monitor malaria vaccine safety. The prompt and rigorous investigation of any potentially linked SAEs also serves to maintain confidence in the immunization programme.\nResearch priorities: For all WHO-recommended malaria vaccines, operational research is needed, specifically in relation to the seasonal delivery approach. The research should include annual pre-transmission season dosing after three doses given through age-based delivery, and how best to deliver the combination of SMC and seasonal malaria vaccination. Countries are encouraged to document and evaluate their experience with malaria vaccine introductions – in particular for seasonal deployment of the vaccine, expanded age range, or a five-dose schedule – to provide additional input for future updates to the guidance, including on vaccine effectiveness, feasibility and the occurrence of adverse events following immunization. Monitoring and evaluation of immunogenicity and reactogenicity of mixed vaccine use is not required but should be documented where feasible. A number of research priorities have been identified for R21/Matrix-M. However, introduction should not be delayed pending the completion of these studies. These priority research topics include: co-administration with childhood vaccines; post-licensure studies on vaccine effectiveness in high perennial transmission settings; impact on severe malaria and mortality; monitoring of safety in infants and young children; and interchangeability studies to evaluate safety and effectiveness in children who receive different malaria vaccines in the same schedule. WHO also encourages international and national funders to support relevant learning opportunities.\nEvidence to decision: Benefits and harms. Malaria vaccines, provided in a four-dose schedule, have been demonstrated in clinical trials to significantly reduce clinical malaria, providing substantial added protection to that already given by existing malaria preventive measures (i.e. ITNs and/or seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC)). In addition, pilot implementation showed that the introduction of the vaccine through routine childhood immunization programmes in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi resulted in substantial reductions in all-cause mortality, severe malaria and hospitalization with malaria. In a large Phase 3 trial, age-based vaccination with three doses of RTS,S/AS01 resulted in significant reductions in clinical malaria (51%; 95% CI: 47–55) and severe malaria (45%; 95% CI: 22–60) during 12 months.",

The largest numbers of cases averted per 1000 children vaccinated were at sites with the greatest disease burden, reaching more than 6500 cases averted per 1000 children vaccinated with four doses.[179]\n◦ Vaccine efficacy was not affected by either ITN or indoor residual spraying (IRS) use during the RTS,S/AS01 Phase 3 trial [180].\n• During seven years of follow-up in a subset of children from three of the 11 Phase 3 trial sites, there were significant reductions in clinical malaria in children who received four doses (24%; 95% CI: 16–31) or three doses (19%; 95% CI: 11–27). Therefore, children who received three or four doses of RTS,S/AS01 benefited for at least seven years after vaccination and did not have an excess risk of clinical or severe malaria.[181]\n• The R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccine has also demonstrated efficacy in a multi-centre Phase 3 trial; when given through an age-based approach, there was a significant reduction in clinical malaria (66%; 95% CI: 56–73) during 12 months of follow-up after the third dose [182].\n• High public health impact was also demonstrated through the pilot implementation of RTS,S/AS01. Over 46 months of vaccine introduction via routine immunization systems in parts of Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, there were significant vaccine-attributable reductions in all-cause mortality (excluding injury) (13%; 95% CI: 3–22), hospitalization with severe malaria (22%; 95% CI: 3–36) and hospitalization with malarial parasitaemia or antigenaemia (17%; 95% CI: 5–27) among children who were age-eligible for vaccination (Milligan P and Fogelson A, unpublished evidence).\n• Providing malaria vaccines through a seasonal approach has been shown to increase vaccine efficacy.\n◦ Among children who received a combination of RTS,S/AS01 seasonal vaccination and SMC, there was a substantially greater reduction in clinical malaria (72%; 95% CI: 64–78), compared to SMC alone, during 12 months of follow-up after the third dose. Results were similar after three years of follow-up, with significant reductions in clinical malaria (63%; 95% CI: 58–67), hospital admissions with severe malaria (71%; 95% CI: 42–85) and deaths from malaria (73%; 95% CI: 3–92), compared to SMC alone. Seasonal vaccination with RTS,S/AS01 before the peak transmission season was non-inferior to SMC in preventing clinical malaria (hazard ratio: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.84–1.01) [183].\n◦ Similarly, when R21/Matrix-M was given through a seasonal approach together with SMC (provided as standard of care by the government), there was a significant reduction in clinical malaria (75%; 95% CI: 71–78) during 12 months of follow-up after the third dose [182].\n◦ The efficacy measured for the two vaccines was in addition to the existing interventions being provided (high ITN coverage, provided as part of the trial, and SMC, provided as part of the trial or administered by the ministry of health).\n• Modelling estimates that approximately 450 deaths can be averted per 100 000 children vaccinated with an age-based four-dose schedule of RTS,S/AS01 in areas of moderate to high transmission. A seasonal schedule of RTS,S was estimated to result in greater reductions in cases and deaths than an age-based schedule across all endemicity settings, and an additional fifth dose increased this impact (Full evidence report on the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine, unpublished evidence). A four-dose schedule of R21/Matrix-M, using an age-based, seasonal or hybrid delivery approach, is estimated to avert between 216 and 733 deaths per 100 000 children vaccinated in areas of low to high transmission [184].\nThe malaria vaccines are safe and well tolerated [178].\n• There is a small risk of febrile seizures within seven days (mainly within 2–3 days) of vaccination, with an attributable risk of 2.5 per 1000 doses of RTS,S/AS01 administered and 1.0 per 2800 doses of R21/Matrix-M administered. The seizures resolved without long-term consequences [185][186][187].\n• As with any vaccine, proper planning and training of staff to conduct appropriate pharmacovigilance should take place prior to vaccine introduction [178].\nMore information can be found in the Full evidence report on the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine (unpublished evidence) sections 5.3.2 and 6.1 (MVIP safety, methods and results), sections 5.3.3 and 6.2 (MVIP impact, methods and results), section 7.2 (Phase 3 results), section 8 (Additional data since Phase 3 completion), and section 9 (Modelled public health impact and cost-effectiveness estimates), and in the Full evidence report on the R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccine (unpublished evidence) section 6.2 (Vaccine efficacy against all episodes of clinical malaria), section 7.4 (Overall assessment of R21/Matrix-M safety), and section 10 (Modelled public health impact and cost-effectiveness estimates of R21/Matrix-M).\nFurther details on “Benefits and harms” are also included in the SAGE/MPAG Evidence-to-recommendations framework for RTS,S/AS01 (unpublished evidence) and R21/Matrix-M (unpublished evidence).\nHigh Certainty of the evidence\nThe overall rating of the evidence on malaria vaccines is HIGH. The certainty of evidence ranged from very low to high.\nCertainty of the evidence related to the effectiveness of RTS,S/AS01 based on critical outcomes was mostly rated HIGH in the large-scale Phase 3 clinical trial and MODERATE (due to wide CIs) in the pilot implementation study.\nCertainty of the evidence on the safety of RTS,S/AS01 was rated MODERATE. Three safety signals, thought to be chance findings, were identified in the Phase 3 trial; these rare, unexplained events were graded as LOW and VERY LOW certainty of evidence: an excess of meningitis and cerebral malaria (in the context of overall reduction in severe malaria), and an excess of deaths among girls who had received RTS,S/AS01 (shown in a post hoc analysis compared to boys).\nThe Malaria Vaccine Pilot Evaluations were designed to answer the outstanding questions related to safety.\nCertainty of the evidence on the safety outcomes of meningitis, cerebral malaria and gender-specific mortality is now graded MODERATE, reflecting the wide CIs related to relatively rare events.
